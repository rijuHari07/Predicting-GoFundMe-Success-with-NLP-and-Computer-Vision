___________________________________________
We are coming together to raise funds for a permanent headstone for Trey Reed—a son, a brother, a friend, and a life taken too soon. Trey's memory with dignity, love, and respect.
But this is more than just about a headstone. Trey's life and death represent the urgent need to keep fighting for justice. Every contribution helps us not only cover the costs of his headstone but also support ongoing organizing efforts: protests, awareness campaigns, and community action to make sure his story is never forgotten and that no other family has to endure this pain.
Your donation will:
Provide Trey with a beautiful headstone to honor his legacy.
Support the continued fight for justice in his name.
Help cover the cost of organizing protests, community outreach, and advocacy.
Trey Reed's life mattered.
His story matters.
Together, we can honor him properly and carry his spirit forward in the struggle for justice.

Their farm in Newburg, MD suffered a tragic loss on Wednesday, Oct 1, 2025.
Around 10 pm, Gabrielle noticed their 75x100 grain house was on fire. Despite efforts by firefighters from three different counties, the flames proved to be too much. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in product, numerous grain cleaning, sorting, heating, drying and grinding machinery were destroyed in the fire by early morning. While insurance will cover the cost of certain things, it won’t meet the replacement value on anything. Their once bustling grain mill is no more and the grain cultivated and grown for decades has vanished with the smoke. I am crushed for this passionate, hardworking, and humble family and am asking you to assist them in any way possible.
Next Step Produce was always ahead of its time cultivating wholesome, nutritious morganic (‘more than organic’) grains, fruits, vegetables, spices, and more for over 25 years.
They have been supplying some of DC and Baltimore's finest restaurants, bakeries, and also used to be a feature at DC’s DuPont farmers market pre-Covid. After Covid, Heinz pushed full steam ahead with grain production, including varieties of rice, wheat, and beans. Every single machine used towards that endeavor has been lost to the fire. Grain growers from all over the East Coast would source Heinz and his setup to process their own grains. On top of that, decades of work and germination testing, along with all the seeds saved, were also consumed in the fire.
This loss is devastating, to say the least.
Anything, including an encouraging word or gesture, would be of great help.
I thank you for reading this and I appreciate all the thoughts and prayers directed towards the Thomet family during this time.

We, the former employees of The Trading Musician, are starting a brand new music shop in the U District - just three blocks from the old place, right across from Cowen Park. We’re excited to see you all again at Re-Animated Music, and we want to share the story and the mission statement with you.
When the old place shut down last year it left a massive crater in our music scene. Many of us grew up going there, met bandmates and best friends, bought our first and tenth and favorite guitars, and we know that many of you did too. We were able to help everyone from local folks just starting out to high profile touring bands. We always took pride in being accessible, affordable and fair - but more than that it was a place to see your friends, talk about music, learn about weird gear and get a pack of strings or a pair of drum sticks. We were a refreshing alternative to the big corporate hellscape of a music store up the street.
We all tried working and shopping at other places, but the DIY ethos just wasn’t there, and we didn’t feel they shared our values of how a music shop should be run. These core principles are imperative to what we want our new shop to be:
Keeping instruments available to everyone without a huge paywall or price point that bars the average musician from obtaining vintage equipment. Continuing to serve the community as a resource for information and education. Hosting workshops and empowering you with the knowledge to properly use and maintain your gear. Stocking an extensive library of parts, and providing the services you need to make your instruments the best they can be. Making sure that everything we sell is set up to our standard of playability regardless of price. At its core, we want this new store to be an inspiring place that has the things you need and the off-the-beaten-path treasures you didn’t know you wanted. We want the focus to be on helping our peers - not getting rich.
It became clear that if we wanted to stay in the industry, we needed to start a place of our own. After months of searching, we found the perfect location earlier this year, and we’ve been working to get it ready ever since. The people we meet walking by every day, the musicians we talk to at shows, and the folks that pull over just to look inside all seem really excited for what’s coming.
Our hope was to be open for business back in June but we encountered some massive setbacks with the city. Our renovation and build-out quickly ballooned to double the initial cost and tripled the timeline to open. We heard the same story from all our friends who are contractors, tradespeople, business owners - that this city has no interest in making it easy for small businesses to start up or stay afloat. There are endless and ever-changing hoops to jump through, and every license and permit along the way is expensive. Even seemingly minor regulations can have huge, prohibitively costly implications and these things can, and have, bankrupted businesses before they even get off the ground. Not a problem if you’re a massive corporation or tech company, but the very same hundreds of thousands of dollars are expected of ordinary people, DIYers and independent artists. Since there is no system in place to help lessen that burden, what ends up happening is exactly what you’d expect: the big companies flourish while the mom-and-pops go out of business if they ever exist in the first place.
This is not an accident. Cool alternative businesses usually don’t present a big economic gain for the city, so there’s very little incentive for them to make it work. It’s a calculated effort to prioritize profit over people and community. This is why we have fewer and fewer shops like the one we aim to build. The odds are increasingly stacked against us.
As local musicians, we know people need this kind of place. Places to be together and learn from each other. Places to invent new sounds and fix broken instruments, where everyone involved knows it’s about bringing the music to life - not getting rich. It’s up to us to take care of each other and support the few spots where we can still encounter vibrant interactive art.
We're committed to making it happen. We are here putting in the work, and we are so close to being ready to share this with you, but the costs so far have been pretty staggering. None of us had startup money and after the unexpected and expensive remodels the city required (and the months of rent it took to complete them), we are facing some super intimidating loans. Your donations will be immensely helpful in recouping some of our debt and covering those extensive building costs while we get started. We are endlessly grateful for whatever you can contribute, and we hope that you’ll come hang out with us when we open the doors - we’re shooting for Halloween.
P.S. There are plenty of other ways to help out aside from donating. Please get in touch with us if you have used gear you’d like to sell or donate. We could really use some rugs and carpet - and probably more stuff we’ll think of later. We want to hear from you, even just to talk.

I’ve worked at the Dairy Queen in Medford, NY for years, and I can say without hesitation that our “DQ Sisters” — Michelle and Pat — are more than just owners. They are the heart of this place, and for so many of us, they’ve become family.
I’ve seen it with my own eyes: they’ve stepped in like surrogate mothers when life gets tough. They’ve pulled off Christmas miracles for employees’ kids, quietly paid for funerals, celebrated graduations, and lifted us up through struggles big and small. When one of our team members was battling cancer, they organized a fundraiser to help cover costs. They’ve handed employees money out of their own pockets when someone couldn’t make rent or cover an emergency expense.
The DQ Sisters have also built this Dairy Queen into a true second chance company. They hire people others might overlook — those with disabilities, people rebuilding after addiction, and even folks with felony records who just needed someone to believe in them. For many of us, this place was the only door that opened when every other one was shut. Working here has never just been a job — it’s been a safe, stable, and caring home because of Michelle and Pat.
Now, they’re facing something that could take it all away.
Back in 2020, the DQ Sisters were blindsided with a class action lawsuit over a technicality in how often “manual workers” are paid under New York law. They always followed the state’s guidance, worked through ADP payroll, and made sure every cent of our paychecks was right. But the lawyers wouldn’t back down.
Under immense pressure, Michelle and Pat were forced to settle for $450,000 — more than $300,000 of which went straight to attorney’s fees. The rest will be divided among over 200 employees in the class action (most of whom had no idea this lawsuit even existed).
The most heartbreaking part? The sisters fought to change the law so other small businesses wouldn’t suffer the same fate — and they actually succeeded. But their victory came too late to save themselves.
This settlement has left them devastated. I’ve watched them give their lives to keep this Dairy Queen running for us and our community. And now, unless we rally around them, we could lose it all.
That’s why I’m asking — as a friend, an employee, and someone who loves these women like family — for your help. Every donation will go directly toward helping Michelle and Pat cover this crushing settlement and keep our Dairy Queen open.
If you’ve ever been touched by their generosity, enjoyed a cone or a Blizzard made with love, or simply believe in standing up for good people in a bad situation, please donate if you can and share this far and wide.
Let’s keep the lights on, the soft-serve flowing, and the spirit of the DQ Sisters alive in Medford.",5363,21.0,

I'm Haley, and my husband, Alec, and his business partner (and close friend), David, opened their new business a week and a half ago. Their grand opening was meant to be on October 11th of this year. Alec and David have poured all their energy and passion into the last seven months, making this building a reality for their dreams. Yesterday evening, a neighboring business caught on fire, and the flames impacted Alec and David's new shop. They will no longer be able to open their business, with what wasn't damaged by fire damaged by water-- including very many sentimental art pieces that the two painted. With the current state of the building, our families are left without direction on where to go next. Alec and David are without means to continue working at this time and are hopeful they will be able to reopen soon.
Alec and David are some of the kindest, most generous people I have ever known. While I may not have an objective perspective, I have witnessed Alec go out of his way time and time again to help his community and the people he loves, even at an inconvenience to himself. David and his wife, Alisun, have always opened the doors of their home to any of their friends who needed a place to stay or a meal on a holiday.
It is devastating to our families as we have been overjoyed to see their life's work come to fruition. We never expected to have to ask for help in this way, and appreciate any kind words or support.",8653,3.0,"Motor vehicle, Automotive lighting, Car, Automotive Exterior, Automotive Parking Light"

I am a mother of six children – four boys and two girls – living in Gaza, where life has turned into a daily struggle for survival.
Since the start of this brutal and bloody war, my children and I have been living through unimaginable fear and suffering. The continuous attacks, the destruction all around us, and the endless nights of terror have left deep scars on our hearts. But what makes survival even harder is the ongoing siege that has cut us off from the most basic necessities of life.
Food is scarce, and what little is available comes at prices we cannot afford. Hygiene items, clean water, clothes, and even the simplest household needs have become almost impossible to find. My children often go to bed hungry, and as a mother, it is unbearable to see their small faces looking at me for comfort when I have so little to give.
The blockade has not only destroyed our economy but also our ability to live with dignity. Every day feels like a fight against time — against hunger, cold, and fear. We are trying to survive, but survival is impossible without help.

It was a hard decision to run this GoFundMe to raise money for the restaurant. In the beginning, thanks to some very good friends that helped by investing in the restaurant with good startup capital. But as we began paying dues, like the security deposit and first month for the restaurant, applying for the permit, licenses, and insurances, we got a couple of small pieces of equipment. But mainly, we had to take some of the restaurant capital and put it in Borinquen Lunch Box to keep it running, especially to pay $4000.00 to repair the generator, something that took us by surprise.
So now we are facing a shortfall in capital to be able to open the restaurant on time by our deadline. We applied for a couple of capital loans but were denied because our restaurant is not in operation yet. They were all asking for a minimum of 6 months in operation and at least $250,000 in revenue. So I came to a hard decision to ask for help from all of you. If there is any way that you all can donate and help us open this restaurant, I will be very grateful. That will help us buy a new and needed commercial oven and eventually a new beer fridge for the bar. Enough to pay the new hires' training until we open the restaurant. Also, buy the startup inventory and provisions: food, beverage, and liquor.
We will appreciate any donations. I know some people like to stay anonymous, but please leave us your phone number or email to thank you .

I’m Kelsey Graber, married to fourth generation, Robert Graber, into a 131-year-old family business named the Graber Olive House in Ontario, California. Our 131-year-old family business, the Graber Olive House, is in danger of being lost forever. As many of you know, the property is currently closed and now in the foreclosure process. Without immediate help, our community risks losing a piece of living history. For more than four generations, our family has poured our hearts and lives into this landmark, welcoming school tours, weddings, and family visits that have created countless memories for so many.
Even though foreclosure has begun, it is not yet final. With your support, we still have a chance to preserve the property and cover urgent expenses. Every donation will go directly toward utilities, loan payments, and essential operating costs needed to try to reopen its doors and prevent this one-of-a-kind site from being lost to development. We are at risk of losing this landmark in the coming months without support.
The Graber Olive House is more than just our family business, it is a living part of California’s history. On the grounds stand towering redwoods, a 250-year-old California Live Oak, and the original “Graber’s Firethorn” plant. The property is also home to the CC Graber House, olive trees, palm trees, and unique plants like the fragrant Watsonia marginata, which has been part of the site’s story for generations.
As long as we are able, we are committed to doing everything possible to continue preserving it for future generations.
Please consider donating and sharing to help us navigate this extremely difficult time and to give this historic landmark a fighting chance to survive.
Challenges we experienced and continue to face:
• COVID closures: Tours, events, and retail traffic—our lifeblood—dropped dramatically, wiping out critical operating revenue for an extended period.
• A poor crop season: Low to no yields, higher processing costs meant less product to sell, and thinner margins.
• A family buyout: To continue the family business, we took on additional obligations that became difficult to service once revenue fell.
• Rising costs: Insurance, utilities, materials, state wages, and maintenance for a 131 year-old property all climbed, compounding the strain.
• Partnership setback: A preservation partnership was halted when there was an appeal to our conditional use permit, leading the city to impose restrictive conditions that made it nearly impossible to operate fully as an event venue to cover costs in deferred maintenance on our property.
• Loss of Investors: Because of the city’s restrictive conditions, investor confidence has declined, forcing us once again to fight alone in search of someone who truly believes in preservation over quick profit.
We’re doing everything we can, but time is running out. Please donate or share to help us protect this irreplaceable piece of Ontario’s history. Please follow us on Facebook at Graber Olives for updates and news.

We are the Mendez Family, and we’ve proudly owned and operated LA PAZ Mexican Restaurant for 47 years. We consider El Segundo our home. Recently we faced an unexpected and devastating event: a car accident caused significant damage to our restaurant, leaving us struggling to continue our operations.
We are now facing an enormous financial strain. Insurance won’t kick in for at least three months. In the meantime, we are trying to support our staff and their families. We fully plan to rebuild and repair the restaurant. We cannot operate until our building is inspected for safety.
We work day to day to pay our staff and our greatest concern is supporting them and their families. 11 employees and their families are struggling right now while we remain closed. We are looking towards our community to help us bridge the gap to support our employees and keep our business afloat until we can reopen.
We are asking for your help to raise $60,000 which would cover one month of our operating costs. Nearly 40% of that goes towards our employees. We also have vendors that need to be paid, rent, and utilities that are due. These funds will go directly to these immediate expenses. Any contribution, big or small, will make a world of difference and will allow us to continue serving the community that we love.
We’ve proudly served the greater El Segundo community for 47 years and though we’ve faced hardships like Covid, recessions, and relocation, we’ve never faced a situation like this where we cannot operate in any capacity. We’ve always been able to find a way through, but we are running out of options. Please help us weather this storm by donating and/or sharing this page.",15959,9.0,"Motor vehicle, Car, Automotive Tire, Automotive Exterior, Automotive lighting"

《追光者 PULSE HK》是一個全新的香港人國際新聞平台，由兩大海外港媒英國《追新聞》與台灣《光傳媒》，聯同前《自由亞洲電台》粵語組主任、前《有線新聞》中國組主管胡力漢，以及前《蘋果日報》動新聞主管李家聰共同創立。新平台計劃在三個地方設有分社：台灣、英國、北美，為世界各地的香港人提供24小時新聞。
為何要眾籌？
我們的新聞平台屬於香港人，會以專業持平的態度報道新聞，為香港人發聲。惟我們背後並沒有金主或「大水喉」支持，要讓《追光者》成為黑暗中的燈塔，必須要靠大家的參與及貢獻。
眾籌用途？
我們計劃組成15至20人的專業團隊，成員都是流散世界各地的資深新聞人，希望藉着我們的豐富經驗及新聞觸覺，填補過去幾年香港新聞界因為無法看到的紅線而出現的黑洞。我們會專注影像報道，除每日半小時新聞，亦會製作「懶人包」影片；另會提供深入的中國調查報道。PULSE HK 將設「英語組」，以英語報道香港本地以及國際新聞，尤其專注於世界各地港人社群關心的社會時事。
為何是400萬？
要維持這個運作規模，我們預算每月開支最少要港幣50萬元，長遠我們打算透過讀者訂閱、廣告及 YouTube 收益做到收支平衡，但估計要6至8個月時間才能達成目標，因此我們希望眾籌港幣400萬元作為新平台的起動資金。
一個新聞平台，永遠不能單獨存在，它是一個有機之物，如何生存、成長，並非幾個人之事。這點光，能否成為一座照亮黑暗的燈塔，在充滿暗湧的黑濤中，為迷茫的航行者帶來一絲慰藉和安穩，就讓我們一起努力吧。
創辦人的話
胡力漢：不論中國和香港，整個世界已變得模糊——我們肩負的責任更大、更要堅持對光的追尋。
李家聰：一日新聞人，一世新聞人，但願能在自由之地繼續報道，抱擁新聞自由，堅持真相，為民發聲。
梁嘉麗：《光傳媒》創刊辭是「風雨飄搖」，兩年多過去，這場風雨沒有停下來，風更大了，雨也更猛。今天之後，離散媒體進入新時代，我們將繼續堅守專業，繼續努力為大家寫下歷史初稿。真相，絕不容許被篡改。
《追新聞》：四年前我們離開香港，有種責任在海外延續記者之路。今天我們亦基於最大的公眾利益，與志同道合的同道走在一起，希望結合一把更大的聲音，繼續報道真相。
PULSE HK: Crowdfunding a New Platform for Global Hongkongers
PULSE HK is a brand new international news platform for Hongkongers. It is founded by two overseas Hong Kong media outlets — The Chaser News (UK) and Photon Media (Taiwan) — together with Wu Lik-hon (former Director of RFA’s Cantonese Service and former Head of i-Cable News’ China Desk) and Edward Li (former Head of Multimedia News at Apple Daily).
With planned bureaux in Taiwan, the UK, and North America, PULSE HK will provide 24/7 news for Hongkongers around the world.
Why Crowdfund?
PULSE HK belongs to the people. We are committed to reporting the news fairly, professionally, and without fear or favour — giving voice to Hongkongers wherever they are.
But we do not have wealthy backers or secret sponsors behind us. If this platform is to become a beacon in the dark, it must be built by you, with you.
How Will the Funds Be Used?
We plan to assemble a professional news team of 15–20 experienced journalists, now scattered across the globe. With our sharp instincts and deep understanding of the region, we hope to fill the news vacuum left by the invisible red lines imposed on Hong Kong’s media in recent years.
We will focus on video storytelling — producing daily 30-minute news programmes and explainer videos, as well as in-depth investigative reporting on China.
PULSE HK will also include an English-language desk, covering both local and international news with a special focus on stories that matter to Hongkongers abroad.
Why HK$4 Million?
To run a newsroom of this scale, we estimate monthly costs of at least HK$500,000. Our long-term goal is to sustain the operation through reader subscriptions, advertising, and YouTube revenue.
However, we expect it will take 6 to 8 months to reach that goal — which is why we’re crowdfunding HK$4 million as our start-up fund.
A news platform cannot thrive in isolation. It is a living organism—its survival and growth depend on collective strength and public trust. Whether this glimmer of light can grow into a beacon in the turbulent dark waters, guiding those adrift toward hope and clarity, we leave that to all of us, together, to realize.
Words from the Founders

Ben here, and I want to share something really personal and important about Blue Ocean and our journey. For those of you who’ve been following us, you know we’ve poured our hearts into this restaurant for years. We’ve served up countless bowls of ramen, celebrated with you over sushi, music, events, and built a great community right here in St. Louis.
But now we’re at a turning point. You might have heard some of the rumblings: the building owners are pushing us out to make room for a new tenant. They want us gone in 30 days—an impossible timeline for a small business like ours. And the truth is, we just don’t have the funds on hand to secure a new lease, especially with all the upfront costs.
We’ve always been the underdogs, and we’ve overcome a lot—from surviving the tough years after COVID to keeping Blue Ocean alive and thriving. But this time, we need a little help from our friends, family, and the incredible community that’s supported us all along. We’re launching a GoFundMe to raise the funds we need to secure a new space and keep Blue Ocean’s legacy alive.
So, if Blue Ocean has ever given you a great meal, a memorable night, or just a warm place to gather, we’d be so grateful for your support. Every little bit helps, and even just sharing our story means the world to us.
Thank you for being part of our family. Let’s keep Blue Ocean sailing.

Most importantly, everyone made it out of the cafe safely. Our wholesale team was in at the time and noticed when the freezer caught fire. They acted quickly with a fire extinguisher until the Ann Arbor Fire Department came to clear out the rest of the fire and smoke. We are so grateful that everyone is safe and for the quick action taken by both our staff and the fire department. While we are lucky the fire was quickly put out and did not spread further, we are still unfortunately left with extensive damage that will take time to repair. To give an idea: everything in the cafe must be removed and professionally sanitized and cleaned, the wall the freezer was against will need to be torn down and rebuilt, ceiling tiles, insulation, and equipment will have to be replaced due to smoke damage, along with an almost total loss of inventory. We don’t know how long exactly this will all take or whether or not our insurance will be able to cover all of the associated costs. The road ahead of us is a bit uncertain, but there are two things we are absolutely sure of: we will get back to serving the community we love so dearly just as quickly as we can and we will do everything in our power to support and retain our amazing team during this time - they are what makes Juicy Kitchen the special place that it is. While this situation has been incredibly stressful and heartbreaking, we have been so touched by all the love and support we have received from our community. So many people have asked what they can do to help, and our biggest concern is making sure our staff is taken care of. We are humbly asking for donations to support our team while we are closed for repairs. They are so special and work so hard to nurture our beloved guests with their food and service - we can’t imagine reopening without them.

I grew up in this restaurant, My school bus would drop me off in front & my mom would meet the bus driver with a burro for her drive home.
I sat and did homework at the booth closest to the kitchen, and once I was able to bus tables I did, and then waitressed.
Once I became a mom I took a step back from waitressing, But remaining very much involved..So I as well as my brother & sister, have had a front row seat at my parents blood, sweat & tears go into this business for 26 years!

We, like most other small businesses, have been hit hard by recent market conditions (city structure changes, tariffs, rising costs, and surprisingly, climate change). We are in arrears for August and September rent, owe a “surprise” tax bill from 2023 due at the end of September, and need to make emergency repairs due to ongoing water damage from a changing water table to make our space safe for the remainder of our lease.
When I walked out of my marriage from a world-class cancer researcher around this time 10 years ago, I couldn’t have imagined that I would have the opportunity to give back not only the immense scientific knowledge I had picked up from 20+ years of hanging out in research labs but from living with a narcissistic, emotional (and physical) abuser. I took my half of the proceeds from our co-owned house and bought Hubba after the previous owner passed so that this iconic store could live on.
Since then, I have sunk all my savings, my retirement, and often go without paychecks to keep the business running. My family has contributed all they can. I have maxed out my credit cards and taken high-interest loans to keep the business afloat through Covid and beyond. I have made many mistakes along the way, but I have tried to learn and grow as a person. I truly believe that we are finally finding our groove.
For the past couple of years, we have operated at a loss, and I have filled in those gaps but we are on the precipice of real prospects for growth and success despite the current state of the world.
We have the greatest staff. We have weekly trainings, meetings, and brainstorming sessions. We try to listen to our customers and be nimble in our product selection to meet the needs of our community. We really want to expand. There are real opportunities and importance for a store like ours in today’s climate. Massachusetts is poised to become a haven for the LGBTQ+ community (especially for trans individuals) and as laws change across the country, access to sexual health products and information is becoming very limited. Access to fashion and accessories from other countries is also becoming prohibitively expensive to obtain on an individual level. We have always tried to bring in the best products at value-driven prices.
Our ask
: we want to make our existing space safe for the remaining length of our lease (4 years).
We want to grow, do more with the community, and expand!
We want to celebrate 50 years in business (in 2028!)
We are currently working on exciting collaborations!
We are starting an online educational newsletter! (

We are starting an online education program!
The construction in our area in the fall of 2023 (city replacement of pipes, resealing of the driveway behind the building, and other local construction projects), changed the water table in our area so that water began seeping through the walls into our below grade space. We have fought the good fight in keeping the space “safe,” running three HEPA filters constantly, constantly cleaning, bringing in the Health Department, running mold tests, etc. but it has taken a toll on the health and welfare of me and my employees. The landlord is finally “fixing” the leaking walls. (
Please note: The store may be under construction in late September for a week.
) However, we also need to repair the floor that was improperly installed and has been subjected to 10 years of water damage from various floods, as well as repair damaged walls, fixtures, and other major/minor repairs. Ideally, this will happen at the same time as the water mitigation repair to minimize any interruption to store operations.
Our big ask
: we also have the opportunity to take on additional space to expand the store but that takes real money… We have been storing our back stock in a off-site storage space in Everett (lowest cost), but if we would expand into the empty storage space available to us, we could expand our social media presence (including more online classes, podcasts, webinars), process inventory off the sales floor, and have more product available, including our own branded products. We would also increase the size of our currant sales floor! Which begs the question, what would you like to see more of?!
Level I Ask: Immediate Needs
Rent: August/September $14,000
Tax Bill: $3,000
New Floor/Repairs: $6,000
Level II Big Ask: Help Hubba Expand
Rental for new space: $20,000
Construction: $10,000
Initial new inventory: $30,000
Why should I give money to a “sex store?”
First off, we are not a “sex store.” We are, and have always been, an alternative store that also sells sexual health products, just like many mainstream stores like Target, CVS, or many department stores; except we are knowledgeable (and opinionated) and care about you and what you put on and in your body. Second, if you don’t support choice, you won’t have choice. Soon, your only option for buying products will be monopolies who will control what you see and what price you pay.
Popular misconceptions about the store are that we are not needed unless you are kinky; or until your relationship is on the rocks, are single, or enter menopause or have any other health condition, or a loved one is LGBTQ; or any myriad of reasons that people enter the store with real questions and real issues that they either haven’t gotten sufficient answers from the medical community or don’t feel comfortable discussing. But the truth is we are here for everyone. Everyday. Welcoming and accepting. Sometimes just to answer a question. Sometimes with sizes others don’t carry. Or styles not available anywhere else. Sometimes, we are just the only place left in the city.
Now, more than ever, our mission is vital. We are one of the last stores of our ilk standing, and unique in our mix, the communities we serve, and our ability to evolve.

We are planting the seeds of something beautiful—a yoga studio that is more than just a place to practice. It will be a sanctuary where people can come home to themselves, rest in stillness, and reconnect with their true nature.
In a world that moves quickly, many of us long for a space that invites us to slow down, breathe deeply, and remember who we are. This studio will be that refuge—a place of healing, community, and inner transformation.
Here’s our vision:
A warm, welcoming studio infused with calm energy.
Classes, workshops, retreats and trainings to nurture body, mind, and spirit.
Community gatherings that uplift connection, compassion, and purpose.
A sacred space where every being feels safe, seen, and supported.
To bring this vision into reality, we are seeking support.
Your donation—large or small—will help us open the doors to this sanctuary.
Funds will go directly toward creating a beautiful, clean studio space for our community to thrive. A lease has been signed and the space needs a lot of love to get it ready - Demolition of 6 walls, new ceiling, fresh paint, flooring, lighting, props, signage, etc...
How you can support:
Make a donation to help us open our doors.
Share this vision with friends who believe in the power of yoga and community.
Hold the intention with us that this space will blossom into a haven of peace.
Together, we can create something really special.

We want to invite you to be part of the building of our new barn! Our farm has always been about feeding the community, and now we have a chance to build something together that will be the heart of the farm for the future. Each of you, who are part of our farm, can be part of the barn.
We have continued farming since experiencing the worst event in our 25 year history. On February 17, 2024, a fire burned down our 100-year old historic barn. This barn was the center of our farm’s infrastructure, housed our farm store and served as the distribution center for the harvest. Bottom line - we lost our space to sell and distribute organic fresh produce for thousands of people.
We have good news to share! We’ve put all the beautiful generous donations and help from the community to work to keep our farm store open in its temporary spot the last 18 months, and we are now ready to move forward in the building of our new barn for the future of the farm. We wouldn’t be here farming today without you!
We have hired a general contractor, the plans are approved, and the foundation for the new barn has been poured. But the total cost for the building will be $1,200,000!! Even with landing a state grant, the small amount of insurance, and investing all of our available funds, we are looking at a shortfall of over $400,000 due to increased building costs. We hope to raise $200,000 of that. Without the barn, the farm cannot be financially sustainable. And we know, without the community, we can’t build the barn.
*** Breaking news - we have already raised over $25K towards the $200K goal, thanks to early supporters!
We are a living example of what it takes to feed people locally and regionally. Against all odds we have managed to do this. We farm against a backdrop of climate change in a broken system that rewards big corporate farms who use harmful chemicals, and are located thousands of miles away from our community. Our farming uses organic techniques that maintain and improve soil health for the future, and avoid use of herbicides and genetically engineered seeds. We provide jobs to over 80 people and provide the most nutritious food to everyone, regardless of income, whenever possible, by offering a sliding scale farm share, participating in government food relief programs, and donating, annually, over fifty thousand of pounds of produce to food banks, pantries, and soup kitchens.
Although the smart financial move for our family in the aftermath of the fire would have been to close down Red Fire Farm, we haven’t. We are not giving up now - because you have shown that you believe, like us, that growing healthy, local food is vital and needed.
Yes, the new store barn building is a short-term financial drain due to the huge construction costs . But it is the only clear path to the future sustainability of the farm. It will strengthen on-farm sales, allowing us to use more of the farm's harvest on-site instead of trucking to wholesale markets that pay less.
The new store barn will be located at 34 Carver Street in Granby on 25 acres of crop land  in western Mass. People visiting the farm will now be able to walk out to pick-your-own fields and picnic tables. Visiting the farm will be safer and easier, especially for families, as parking will be separate from our farm equipment. And the new farm store barn will have heat in the winter (and bathrooms)! We will have room for a full line of local and regional healthy foods in addition to Red Fire Farm produce, plus space for a small kitchen so we can serve foods made from our produce and ingredients from other local farms.
It has been our life’s work to grow healthy food for thousands of people in our community, but we can’t do it without your help. Please make it possible for the farm to continue into the future.
Thank you, from all of our hearts,
Red Fire Farm owners and farmers, Ryan & Sarah Voiland, and all the Red Fire crew.

The Fridge is coming home to the original spot behind Eastern Market where it all began.
Since 2009, The Fridge has been a beloved underground gallery, helping launch the careers of over 1,000 professional artists and a gathering space for those often left out of the traditional art world: graffiti writers, outsider artists, poets, MCs, queer and trans creatives, returning citizens, and youth with something to say and nowhere to say it.
We’re continuing our support of:
• Black, Brown, Asian, and Native voices!
• LGBTQ+ and nonbinary creators
• Street art, hip-hop, poetry, and raw self-expression
• Zero gatekeeping. No degree or gallery resume required
But in 2023, we lost our space. Rising property taxes, a real estate scam, and a legal battle we didn’t ask for knocked us out. We won in court but still had to close our doors.
Now we’re going back to where it all started and reopening stronger than ever.
Our Goal: $50,000 by October 1st
We’re reclaiming the original location and relaunching by New Year’s 2026. Your donation helps make it happen.

Why This Matters
The Fridge was never just about art. It was about belonging.
Every donation helps reopen a space where:
• Kids can be free to create and be heard
• Queer artists can show their truth without censorship
• Graffiti is celebrated, not criminalized... And on gallery walls!
• People feel seen, no matter where they’re from or what they’ve been through
We’re not starting over. We’re picking up where we left off, in the same location, with the same mission, and an even bigger vision for what DC can be. Just wait until you meet our new community partners!
No raffles, sweepstakes, giveaways, or returns on investment are offered in exchange for any donations made to this GoFundMe.

A Full-Circle Moment
What makes this comeback even more powerful is what comes next.
Shaymar Higgs
, founder and executive director of
The SPACE
, began his creative journey through a pop-up show co-sponsored by The Fridge in 2009. As a young artist with hand-sewing skills, he was invited to intern at The Fridge. That opportunity helped launch a lifelong commitment to creativity, access, and community care.
During his time at The Fridge, Shaymar also helped bring in several nonprofit organizations and built community-based programming for local high school students. That kind of work helped expand The Fridge’s reach and rooted it even deeper in the neighborhood it served.
Years later, Shaymar launched The SPACE as a pop-up of his own. Just like The Fridge, it grew into something bigger. Today, The SPACE is a thriving community hub that offers free classes in 3D printing, digital design, mental health and wellness, entrepreneurship, and more.
Now, these two stories come full circle.
The Fridge will reopen the gallery in its original Eastern Market location and expand its offerings to include:
• Free creative workshops for youth and adults
• 3D printing, laser engraving, and digital design labs
• Entrepreneurship and workforce development programs
• Mental health-centered art and healing practices
This isn’t just a gallery reopening. It’s a return to the community that sparked it all, and a chance to bring even more resources, creativity, and connection to our friends and neighbors in Washington, DC.

Quotes From Our People:
“When we talk about keeping DC weird, the Fridge is the real thing. It’s one of our last independent art spaces still standing, holding the line for experimentation, risk, and community. I’ve spent the past year writing a book about building a permanent space like this—and I can tell you, it doesn’t happen without people stepping up. If the Fridge has ever surprised you, moved you, or just made you feel like you belonged, now is the time to show up and support it.”

This is hard for me to write, but I need help.
Brunch Broth and Bloom was more than a restaurant it was my dream and a place built on love and community. From the Giving Wall to the homemade meals, I wanted it to be a place that made a difference.
Sadly, I was forced to close earlier than I planned. Because of that, I wasn’t able to bring in enough to cover payroll for my staff. They showed up every day, gave their best, and supported me through everything. They deserve to be paid for their work and making that happen is all I care about right now.
I owe $4,000 in wages. Every single dollar raised will go directly to the employees who worked so hard to make Brunch Broth and Bloom what it was. If there's anything over it will go to other vendors I owe.
I know times are hard for everyone, but if you can help me take care of them, I would be forever grateful. Even if you can’t give, sharing this would mean the world.

Celebrating 100 Years of Community & Cinema
For nearly a century, the Moreland Theater has been a proud landmark at the heart of Sellwood. Built in 1925, it is one of the last remaining single-screen theaters in the Portland area—and one of the few still independently owned and operated since 1973. Generations of families have gathered here to laugh, cry, and celebrate the magic of film together.
As we approach our 100-year milestone, we want to ensure the Moreland continues to shine for the next century. Over the years, we’ve made important upgrades—like converting from film to digital and installing new seats to keep your experience comfortable and modern. Now, it’s time to restore the face of the building and bring new life to our community treasure.
Our Vision
The centerpiece of this project is the restoration of our iconic Moreland Theater marquee—the most recognizable feature of our building. We want it to shine bright once again as a symbol of pride for our community. Along with the marquee, we have additional goals:
Fresh paint inside and out (including the auditorium’s soaring ceiling)
Updated electrical systems for safety and efficiency
A new main-floor bathroom for accessibility
Improvements to the stage and screen, allowing us to host live performances like music, comedy, and plays
A refreshed snack bar to serve our guests better
Why We Need Your Help
The past few years have been especially challenging for independent theaters. The COVID-19 shutdowns, the rise of streaming, and industry-wide strikes all deeply impacted attendance. While blockbuster films like Top Gun: Maverick, Barbie, and Wicked give us hope, the road to recovery has been long and difficult.
Yet, through it all, the Moreland has endured—thanks to the loyalty and love of our community. With your support, we can preserve this historic gem and prepare it for a vibrant future.
Be Part of the Legacy
Your donation—whether big or small—makes a direct impact on preserving a landmark that has brought joy to our neighborhood for 100 years. Together, we can restore the marquee, refresh the theater, and ensure that the Moreland continues to be a place where memories are made for generations to come.

Perch was born in 2022 out of our love for great coffee, warm baked goods, and welcoming community spaces. After experiencing layoffs and unsafe work environments during Covid, we dreamed of creating a place where people could gather safely, feel cared for, and be their authentic selves.
When we moved to Waldoboro, we carried inspiration from our favorite Portland coffee shops (shout out to Little Woodfords!) and poured it into Perch. From the very beginning, we’ve been guided by inclusive values—especially creating a queer-affirming space in rural Maine where the LGBTQIA+ community and allies can feel supported and celebrated.
Over the past three years, Perch has grown into so much more than a coffee shop. People come for espresso, warm buttery biscuits, and cinnamon rolls—but they stay for connection, love, and belonging. We’re proud to be a “third space” where folks can show up exactly as they are.
But like many small family businesses, we face daily challenges. Rising costs, a seasonal economy, inflation, and supply-chain impacts have all taken a toll. And now, our beloved espresso machine—the heart of Perch—is on her last legs. Espresso machines are built to last for decades, but after just three years of use, ours is facing irreparable damage. The water quality in coastal Maine has been a major factor, and will require the installation of some additional heavy duty water filtration to remedy the issue.
Why This Matters
Our espresso program isn’t just a menu item—it’s one of our biggest sources of revenue and a core part of the Perch experience. Without it, we face a very real financial cliff this winter.
We need your help to:
☕ Replace our espresso machine and upgrade our water filtration– ensuring we can continue to serve the high-quality drinks you love.
Sustain through winter – so we can grow our hours and days of service, meeting the community’s needs.
Secure a permanent home – to root Perch in Waldoboro for years to come.
How You Can Help
* DONATE what you can—every dollar makes a real difference.
* SHARE this fundraiser with a personal note about what Perch means to you.
* Come VISIT us! Bring a friend, grab a coffee, or look out for upcoming Perch merch.
Perch was always meant to be more than a coffee shop. It’s a space for gathering, for care, for rest and joy. It’s a space where queer folks and allies feel at home. And it’s a space we’ve built with so much love—hand in hand with all of you. We’re proud of what we’ve created here. And we’re hopeful that, with your help, we’ll get through this chapter and grow stronger on the other side. Thank you for reading. Thank you for caring. Thank you for being our community.
Thank you for helping us weather this challenge and build a thriving, inclusive community—together.

We're writing this message with heavy hearts and a sense of vulnerability we never expected to share.
We are Andrew and David, the creators and owners of CRUSH. For the past year, you've shown us so much love, and it's with that same love that we're reaching out to you now because we need your help.
CRUSH was born from a decade-long dream to create a true safe space—a ""love letter"" to this incredible city. After working as bartenders for so many years, we poured our 9 years of life savings we built together and every ounce of our energy into this project. The journey to open was filled with unexpected delays and costs, what we thought would be a quick build out took us a year to open and because of that we opened/started this venture over budget and with nothing left in our pockets. But we had faith in our vision and, more importantly, we had faith in all of you.
Your unwavering support over this past year has been everything to us. Every single visit has helped us pay our incredible staff, our amazing performers, and keep the lights on!! literally. We even sold our home this past June to keep CRUSH going, just so we could continue to provide the space we all love. Our landlord knew our situation, and we’ve been paying our rent weekly, working hard to stay on track.
This last week, however, has been one of the toughest yet. Due to some much-needed repairs and a very slow last 2 months, we weren't able to make our weekly rent payment ontop of having a check bounce on an invoice
from a prior event.
We've just received a notice that if we don't pay the full balance of over $30,000 with an additional 11,440 for rent being due again the 1st of October, we could be locked out of our space anytime our landlord feels he wants to and he’s not required to open it unless we cure our balance.
Our hearts are shattered at the thought of the lights at CRUSH going out for good. This is unbelievably hard for us to share because we’ve always wanted to be the ones giving back, not asking for help. But we've been reminded by a fellow bar owner in our community that asking for help from the people who love you is an act of strength, not weakness.
We don’t want to be another statistic, another cherished safe space lost.
More than ever, we need places where we can come together, feel accepted, and be ourselves.
Seeing your smiles, your laughter, and the beautiful community you've built within these walls is why we fought so hard to open in the first place. We can't bear the thought of losing it all.
If you’ve enjoyed our shows, our pop-ups, and the family we've built, please consider helping us keep CRUSH alive. We are swallowing our pride and asking you to click the link below to help us raise the funds we so desperately need to stay open and get caught up
on the bills and invoices we have fallen behind on.
Thank you for your love, your support, and for being the heart and soul of CRUSH.

Dear Friends,
Since 2020, independent theaters like ours have faced challenges we never imagined. The COVID shutdown hit us hard, and while we’ve worked tirelessly to reopen and keep serving the community, the past few years have stretched us thin.
The Bad Axe Theatre isn’t just a place to see movies—it’s where families have laughed together, where kids have felt the magic of the big screen for the first time, and where friends have shared countless memories. It’s a piece of our town’s history, and we want to make sure it’s part of our future too.
But we can’t do it alone. We’re asking for your help to raise $80,000 to cover essential operating costs and improvements that will allow us to keep the doors open. Your support will help us:
•    Keep the screens lit and the projectors rolling
•    Support our staff and community programming
•    Expand events like retro movie nights, live-streamed sports, and family matinees.
Every donation, large or small, makes a difference. Together, we can keep the Bad Axe Theatre thriving for years to come.

Hello, I’m Audrey Crews, a quadriplegic artist who, at 36, has been living with my condition since a life-changing accident at 16. I’m excited to share my dream of opening NeuraArt Studio, a unique art gallery showcasing my artwork and that of other talented artists using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). This is my first time using this incredible technology to create art, and I’m passionate about bringing this innovative work to the world.
I’m raising funds to make NeuraArt Studio a reality. The money will help secure a gallery space, purchase high-quality canvas prints for sale, cover copyright and trademark costs, and build a website for online sales. My goal is to create a platform where art created through BCIs can inspire and connect people, while fostering a community of diverse artists.
By supporting this campaign, you’re helping me take a significant step toward independence and financial stability through my art. Every contribution brings NeuraArt Studio closer to reality, and I’m deeply grateful for your support. Join me in making this vision come to life—let’s create something extraordinary together!
Thank you,

We started our company back in the early 1990s as a way to market our books, comics, and art prints.
We post new pages of Girl Genius, free for everyone to read, M/W/F on our girlgeniusonline.com website. When we have enough pages, we publish a collection. We’ve won three Hugo awards for our work on the comic!
Things have been going well for a long time, but recently we’ve had a lot of nasty and expensive surprises.
What happened? A number of unexpected medical expenses, a flooded basement, and an expensive legal fight to get our novel rights back. Diamond Comics, our main distributor who got our books into actual stores, went bankrupt and is no longer ordering anything from us. Our convention sales have changed drastically in recent years, we suspect because people would rather buy books online than carry them around a crowded con. Who can blame them? Plus, all that drama and more has slowed down our traditional “one book a year” release schedule, and our income along with it. We thought we could weather that slowdown, but we were wrong.
We have learned from this. We’re making changes to our business model, and we do have projects coming up that we know will put us back on our feet, but all that will take a while to happen. Right now, the next couple of months are looking extremely scary, and we have to find a way to get through them.
We do have a number of other places for our readers to support our work: Our books can be found on our online company store at TopatoCo, preorders for our new Cat medals are now open, and our Patreon continues to roll along! But for those who just want to donate without subscribing or ordering something, here we are on GoFundMe, and we very much appreciate it.
Any money donated here will go to keeping the lights on in the upcoming months, that is, making sure that we can keep on producing our books and art. Thank you for your support in the past, the present, and the future. It means the world.",101728,81.0,"Costume, Costume design, Fictional character"

Over this time, Standing Egg Coffee has become more than just a place to grab coffee—it has grown into a welcoming space where I've built deep connections with my customers through great coffee, hospitality, and community.
Unfortunately, with very short notice,
my new landlord has asked us to vacate our space by the end of September.
This sudden change has left me with the difficult task of finding a new location and rebuilding the cafe that so many of you have come to love.
I am fundraising to help cover the costs of relocating and reopening Standing Egg Coffee.
These funds will go directly toward securing a new space, setting up the cafe, and ensuring that I can continue to provide the same—if not better—coffee, service, and environment that our community deserves.

This is one of the hardest messages we've ever had to write.
After 5 incredible years of serving our community through Edith's Pie, we've come to the painful truth that our time has come. Despite our best efforts, the financial challenges have simply become too heavy to carry.
We are doing everything we can to be here through the holidays to join you for one last Thanksgiving, but
without your help now that may not be possible.
We started this shop with a simple dream: to share comfort, create a welcoming space, bring people together, make good jobs, and make damn good pie. And thanks to you, we've done that one slice at a time. Your support, stories, laughter, and love have filled our little shop with more warmth than any oven ever could.
Now, as we prepare for this difficult transition, we're asking for your help one last time—not to keep us open, but to help us land on our feet.
This GoFundMe is to raise the funds needed to cover some overwhelming expenses as we try to land the plane, pay off vendors, support our small team, and close this chapter with just a hint of dignity.
If our shop has meant something to you, if we've ever been part of your celebrations, comforted you on hard days, or simply brought a smile to your face—we'd be incredibly grateful for any support you can offer as we say goodbye.
Thank you for being part of our story. Thank you for believing in us. And thank you for loving pie.

I woke up on the morning of Wednesday, June 24th, to find my personal Facebook, Instagram, and business Instagram permanently disabled. The last post made on my personal and business Facebook/Instagram pages was one asking people to support my friend at a local Drag Story Time that was happening the next day. I went to sleep and awoke to the permanent ban.
I was eventually able to make contact with a person at Facebook. Facebook stated that they were unable to increase the access of the person with limited access on my page to full admin access, and that Meta does not have the capabilities to fix the issue.
Besides the page supporting my business, I would use the page's reach to help amplify the messages of local community organizations, events, and other small businesses. I was a ""steward"" of the platform, sharing and tagging other businesses, and also religiously ran paid Facebook ads every 2 weeks. Despite all this, my accounts were permanently suspended without warning or explanation. My account was in good standing. The only thing I received was a message stating my account was removed due to ""inauthentic account integrity.""
I opened this store 8 years ago. One year later, when my daughter was 4 weeks old, she and I had to return to work in my store, 6 days a week, postpartum C-section. Some summers, I brought all 3 kids to work with me.
3 years ago, when Roe v. Wade was struck down, I stopped being quiet. I was angry, and I took action to give myself purpose. The last 3 years have been a battle and struggle, with myself and the store being targeted on numerous occasions because of my outspoken defense of human rights.
I am tired, and this latest blow feels like a long line of things/people trying to stop me. I don't want to stop taking action. I don't want one less safe space for people in our community because my store is gone.
My blood, sweat, and tears are literally in this business, and I will continue to keep fighting for my store, my customers, and anyone who has been targeted for being ""different."" Our differences are actually what make America great.
Without being able to access my business Facebook or Instagram, I am having a difficult time marketing my business. For the last 8 years, I have been doing bi-weekly consignment live sales that generate $2-$4,000 in sales a month. Without access to my established Facebook page that has nearly 9,000 followers and a reach of 2 million, my consignment sales have plummeted to $150 per live sale. It has also had a negative effect on store sales.
I love my store, and I love my community. Besides my store and community activism, I am a mom of 3 kiddos aged 14, 13, and 7. I need my business to be able to support my children.
If you want to support my store and what I do, everything on my website www.boldandcurvy.com has FREE SHIPPING, or you can support via this GoFundMe.
All funds raised will go towards outstanding bills and rent for the store.

We are Frank Freccia III, Guinevere Freccia, and Dave D’Andrea Jr, and we’re heartbroken to share that Freccia Brothers Garage, the iconic air-cooled shop on West Putnam Avenue in Greenwich, CT, has been evicted after more than 100 years of continuous operation.
What Happened
Freccia Brothers Garage has been in our family for five generations and has been serving our community for over 100 years. Frank has worked there every day since he was 10 years old, preserving the Freccia name and serving the community with honor, grit, and heart. He worked alongside the original Freccia Brothers and his father Skip.
For years, we have been embroiled in a legal family trust dispute over ownership of the building where Freccia Brothers has always been. Despite being hopeful that it would work out, unfortunately we’ve just learned that we lost the dispute and the family member who won has decided to immediately evict us.
Overwhelmingly, the majority of beneficiaries do not agree with the eviction ruling and want Freccia Brothers Garage’s legacy to remain open and alive.
Who We Are
Frank Freccia III (“Frank 3”)
The heart of the shop. Mechanic, historian, teacher, and steward of the Freccia craft. He devoted his entire life to this garage — showing up every single day with pride and purpose.
Guinevere Freccia
Guinevere launched the brand into the digital era through social media, events, and storytelling. She even introduced Lilly the Car, the beloved VW-turned-personality that brought international attention and joy to the garage’s community.
Dave D’Andrea Jr.
The skilled air‑cooled mechanic at Greenwich’s iconic Freccia Brothers Garage, where for over a decade he’s kept vintage Volkswagens—from Beetles to buses—running smoothly. A longtime family member and beloved face at “The Shop,” he’s widely regarded as one of the best in the business.
Why We Need Your Help
We need help in order to secure a new space and re-open Freccia Bros. Nearly all of our savings have been poured into a 3+ year legal battle to try and save the shop.
Every dollar you contribute goes toward helping us recover — critical expenses, securing a new space, stabilizing our future, and preserving what’s left of a century-old institution that should have never been taken away.
️Ways You Can Help
Donate — Every contribution matters, no matter the size.
Share — Tell your friends, your neighbors, and fellow car lovers.
Tag @FrecciaBrothers — Let’s rally the automotive world behind this.
From the Freccia Family
If you’ve ever walked into our garage or drove by, you know it wasn’t just about cars. It was about community, family, and doing things the right way.
We’re devastated. But we’re not giving up.
With your help, we’ll rebuild — and we’ll make sure the Freccia legacy drives on.
Thank you for standing with us.

S.O.S. (Save Our Store)
Hello, my name is Josie Borchert. My family’s business, Borchert's Meat Market, may soon be no more. Once Roger’s, then Richard’s, and now Borchert’s, this community store has always been family run. Even though I am a full-time teacher, I’ve spent many years working there and now help out alongside my brothers when I can. The store has become part of who we are. But more importantly, it is part of the Maplewood community and beyond.
For 10 years my parents have worked tirelessly—open to close, every day, often without taking a paycheck—just to keep Borchert’s open for the community they love. With four new housing facilities in the area, that community is growing. This economic development has given them hope for the future, but the past is proving difficult to endure. They are desperately holding on for the influx of new families to join our community.
My Mom said that one of the hardest things you can do in life is to ask for help. She was right. The Borchert family is asking for your help.
You’ve been there for my family’s past challenges: break-ins, theft, vandalism, and repairs, but right now, the store is facing its hardest challenge yet. Due to the pressures of today’s economy they are struggling to keep their property taxes current. If the property taxes are not current, the bank that holds the mortgage will pull the note. My family simply doesn’t have time to wait for the housing around us to be completed.
We are urgently seeking your help! Without your support they will have to close the store. The goal is to raise $60,000 in the next couple of months. The funds will pay off their property taxes and cover expenses to keep the store open. Your support of this fundraiser can show the bank that the community is rallying behind this small business.
Borchert’s has supported local parishes, cancer fundraisers, and Scouting America over the years. They have always supported the community, even through the global pandemic. During COVID, the store overcame supply challenges—providing essentials when many other stores were out of stock. This market is my parents’ livelihood, their passion, and their way of giving back. Without it, they would have to start all over again. I honestly believe this is where they are meant to be.
This is your family store where each and every one of you are welcomed as family when you enter through that door. We are all in this together. It may take a great number of people to help out just a little. Let’s not let another small business disappear.
Please support, pray, shop, and drop a little in the bucket.

This campaign is to help launch
The Joy Circles Gang
, a weekly web series, preparing preteens for life's challenges.
Between the ages of 9 and 13, children experience rapid changes in identity, friendships, and responsibilities. They are no longer young children and not quite teenagers. This stage can feel overwhelming, and they are not always equipped with the tools they need to thrive.
Launching January 2026, with the
Joy Circles Gang App
, this mindset-driven program with its live-action series, blends entertainment and education to give kids the support they need in a format they'll enjoy.
The heart of the program is built around ""Models for Life"", simple strategies to help kids strengthen communication, self-management, leadership, and character skills. Parents will recognize the value of these lessons, while preteens will connect with the characters and energy of the show.
View the video to hear how I was reading contemporary fiction and realizing how important it was to highlight issues such as bullying, relationships, and socio-economic differences, and bring them to the forefront for kids of this age.

I can't wait for you to meet Alex, Atticus, Libby, Mia, and Mateo, our Joy Circles Gang!
It costs approximately $1,800-$2,000/month to lease the sound studio and the necessary equipment for filming. It costs about $600/month to fund the app that houses this program. Add to these expenses the insurance, music copyright fees, paying actors, crew, and marketing the program, and it is apparent why we seek backers to help launch this important work.

My name is Lezli, and when I'm not working my full-time job, driving my kids around, and keeping my household running with my husband, you will likely find me reading a book or listening to a book while walking my dog or baking bread and other goodies. For quite some time, I've had a desire to find an outlet for my favorite things (books, bread, and dogs) while also getting to form relationships with others who share similar interests. That's where
Lillian's Book Nook
comes in.
The vision for Lillian's Book Nook is to have a mobile bookstore, primarily selling used books and featuring select new books by local authors. It will also include baked goods from Lillian's Home (my cottage bakery business). The bookstore will travel to different businesses and events in southeast Minnesota, such as coffee shops, breweries, wineries, and maybe even dog parks.
""But your name is Lezli... why Lillian?"" you may ask. Well, in college, I earned the nickname Grandmother Lillian among my group of friends. I was the first to bed, the first to rise, and the one making sure everyone was safe, cared for, and comfortable. That's the type of space I want to create with Lillian's Book Nook - a comfy space where people can stop in to escape the real world and find a new book in which to lose themselves.
My hopes for this mobile bookstore would be to purchase an RV camper and remodel it to create more space and storage for books and people.
I will also need to purchase inventory and work on some basic branding for the vehicle. I am seeking other funding options, but I am putting myself out there to see if any generous people are willing to contribute to my dream. In a world filled with far too much negativity, I want to find a way to bring more joy into people's lives.

McDaniel a born and raised Atlantan from the SWATS.
If you want the whole story read on! But if you're looking for the TLDR section, scroll to the bottom, please!
I grew up in College Park off of Old Bill Cook Road back when there was a Sizzler on Old National. I went to school at Mount Olive Elementary School when it was called just that and I graduated from Creekside High School a little ways from Union City, so the southside has always been my home.
After living what seems like a dozen different lives, I'm back living in the Tri-Cities area again working as a teacher and award-winning children's book author.
Many things have changed around the area including the unfortunate closing of our closest general bookstores.
That's where I come in with Impossible Moon Bookshop!
Impossible Moon Bookshop is a Black woman-owned general independent bookstore and community space on Hapeville's Main Street right next to the Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson Airport and smack dab in the middleish of the Tri-Cities.
If you grew up watching
Moesha
, think Andell's without the food, (because Hapeville already has tons of great restaurants!), or, if you were a fan of
One Tree Hill
, think Karen's Cafe and the events hosted there to support local artists!
It will be a key cosmos for a town that extensively supports the arts on its main street in accord with its designation as a Main Street City by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.
The bookshop is on the main strip beside two local haunts, multiple restaurants, a yoga/Pilates studio, a coffeehouse, a pharmacy, natural food stores, a theater, and across the train tracks from the town’s post office.
I'm bringing in students for tutoring programs, volunteer opportunities for our elderly citizens, art crawls with the City of Hapeville, and anything else folks can create with us!
I look forward to being a good neighbor to the other businesses in town and a resource for people looking for community book clubs or even someone to watch Columbo reruns with them, yes there will be, ""Just One More Thing"" nights at the bookshop :)
I just want folks to feel comfortable in the shop's orbit and to shine with us at Impossible Moon!
This fundraiser is to help build a budget to support:
•	Books for literary inventory
•	Sidelines for the store which will come via local artisans and artists, as well as,
•	Shelving, furniture, and other items to build out and furnish the property for our opening this winter
I am #HopefulInHapeville (hashtag courtesy of Sara Luce from Charis Books & More!) that folks will think that this is as worthy an endeavor as I do and will support this GoFundMe to get this bookshop started in the Tri-Cities!
We're building a community of constellations here and everyone is critical for its success, all help is big help.
For everyone who is looking at a dream and thinking it might be impossible... please keep dreaming out loud. I'm sending you all the good vibrations and hope!
A mentor recently reminded me that this dream started ten years ago and with the help of booksellers and bookshop owners all over the world who have taught and mentored me (THANK YOU BY THE WAY!!!) I'm here and so is this little bookshop that's making its way.
Please donate if you can and please share the good word either way.
Lots of love, hope, and joy,

Now, we have a dream:
to purchase land where we can establish a permanent home for Bamboo Cottage.
2600 Read Street Columbia SC 29204
Owning land means stability, growth, and the ability to expand our menu, host events, and create a cultural hub for Jamaican food and community. It’s a huge step that will allow us to continue sharing our passion for authentic Caribbean flavors for many years to come.
Why We Need Your Help
Purchasing land requires a significant investment that we can’t do alone. Your generous support will go directly toward:
Buying a plot of land for Bamboo Cottage’s new home
Setting up infrastructure like utilities and a proper kitchen space
Creating a welcoming spot for customers to gather and enjoy our food
Every dollar counts, and no donation is too small. Your support is more than just financial—it’s a belief in our vision and a commitment to helping keep the spirit of Jamaican culture alive in our community.
What You Get

Kreate What U Want is at risk of closing its doors — and I need your help.
Hi, I’m Dianne Furphy, founder of Kreate What U Want (KWUW), a creative studio and coaching practice in North Wales, PA. KWUW is more than a business — it’s a safe space where kids, teens, and parents discover coping skills, confidence, and connection through art and mindfulness.
Over the years, KWUW has supported hundreds of kids, teens, and families. I’ve witnessed youth finding their voices through art, teens learning coping skills to manage anxiety, and parents discovering new ways to connect with their children. Families often tell me KWUW is the place where they finally feel safe, seen, and supported.
My Story
As a teen, I longed for guidance and a safe space to express and process my big feelings after watching my mom take her last breath. I had very little support, and what I needed most was to be seen, heard, validated, and cared for. In those moments, art became my refuge. It gave me a way to move through the grief and trauma, to express what words couldn’t, and to begin healing. That experience is what inspired me to create Kreate What U Want, a place where kids and teens could have what I never did: a safe, creative space to work through their emotions and feel supported.
Almost four years ago, during one of the darkest seasons of my life, I faced a near-death health crisis. As I slowly mended my body, I knew I didn’t want to waste another moment. I wanted to finally live out my dream of opening a studio: to build the safe, creative space I had needed as a youth. Even on the hardest days, in pain and discomfort, I poured myself into making it real. I cleaned and painted every wall, advertised, built a client base, and watched my vision come alive piece by piece.
Kreate What U Want became more than a business, it gave me something to live for, alongside my son and his dad. It was, and still is, a dream come true: a space built from resilience, heart, and the belief that creativity and mindfulness can heal.
Community at KWUW
KWUW is more than just 1:1 sessions — it’s also a place of community. Through group workshops, classes, and creative gatherings, kids and teens have the chance to make friends, build connections, and feel like they belong. We also offer STEAM + fun and unique art classes for the homeschooling community, giving students opportunities to learn, collaborate, and explore creativity through hands-on projects. Parents find support and understanding here, too. Whether it’s sitting down for a coaching session, joining a workshop, or diving into a STEAM project, families know KWUW is a place where they are safe, supported, and never alone.
My Credentials
I’ve dedicated my life to this work. I hold a Master’s degree in Counseling & Psychology with a concentration in Art Therapy, a Bachelor’s in Psychology, and an Associate’s in Early Childhood Education. I’ve also pursued ongoing training in mindfulness and life coaching. This blend of education, professional experience, and lived experience is what shaped KWUW into a space that heals, inspires, and empowers.
What Families Are Saying
“Dianne has been wonderful with our son! We have definitely seen an improvement in his positivity and self-control since we have started sessions. His confidence and self-expression have greatly improved!”
— KWUW Parent
""A True Gift – Thank You, Dianne! Dianne has been nothing short of a miracle for our 9-year-old son, who is shy and anxious. From the very first session, she created a safe, welcoming environment where he felt seen and understood. He looks forward to every session with genuine excitement. Dianne has incredible intuition and warmth. She connects with children in a way that feels effortless. Through creative expression and gentle guidance, she has helped our son develop coping strategies that he actually uses in his everyday life. Whether it's calming techniques, confidence-building, or learning to express emotions in a healthy way, the tools he’s gained with her support are making a real, lasting impact.”
— KWUW Parent
“My teenage son suffers from anxiety, lack of confidence, and other emotional challenges that come along with being a teen in the 2020s and Asperger’s. We tried the conventional therapist who wanted to diagnose and prescribe, which truly was not a good option. We were referred to Dianne, and it has made all the difference. He has an outlet to discuss without being judged and has come to accept himself as he is. We are seeing so many milestones and achievements this year, as well as a comfort zone he has obtained in his own skin. He actually asks when his next appointment is. I highly recommend!”
— KWUW Parent
Why Your Support Matters
Right now, rising costs of rent, supplies, and operations make it difficult to keep our doors open. This campaign isn’t just about saving a business, it’s about preserving a safe, creative, and mindful community space that youth and families truly need.
Our starting goal is $10,000. This will help cover essential expenses (rent, supplies, utilities) and buy us the time we need to stabilize and keep serving families. Our stretch goal is $18,000 to secure KWUW for the next 6 months.
✨
Transparency Note
: Whether or not we reach the full goal, every dollar raised will go directly toward keeping KWUW running as long as possible: covering art supplies, youth sessions, and rent. If at some point the studio space cannot be maintained, your donations will still continue KWUW’s mission through other formats, such as virtual classes and community pop-ups.
How Your Contribution Helps
Your donation will go directly toward:
️-> Art Supplies & Materials — so kids and teens always have tools to express themselves
-> Mindfulness & Coaching Programs — to give youth coping strategies they can carry for life
-> Studio Rent & Operations — to keep KWUW open as a safe, welcoming space for families
Suggested impact levels:
$25 = provides art supplies for one youth session + a social media thank-you shout-out
$50 = sponsors a teen’s group workshop + shout-out + your name on our KWUW Gratitude Wall
$100 = funds a 1:1 coaching session for a youth in need + all of the above + a digital thank-you gift (exclusive printable mandala)
$250+ = helps cover studio rent and operations so KWUW can remain open + all of the above + special recognition in our studio & updates
(Donors may remain anonymous if preferred.)
Join the KWUW Fam
Your support is more than a donation, it’s an investment in resilience, creativity, and the next generation. Together, we can ensure that KWUW continues to be a safe space for kids, teens, and families to heal, grow, and thrive.
Thank you for believing in me, in this mission, and in the power of art and mindfulness to change lives.
In Deep Gratitude,
Dianne Furphy

He has endured surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy, and while I’m grateful every day that he is still with us, he has been unable to work. Overnight, I became the sole provider for our family — the true “breadwinner.”
Through the exhaustion of working multiple jobs, one thing became clear: my time and energy belong in something meaningful and lasting. That’s where sourdough comes in. When I bake, I feel grounded. When I share bread, I feel connected.
My goal is to turn my 30 years of sourdough experience into a dream of opening my own micro bakery, ""Millie’s Bread"", where every loaf will be handmade with care, using only the best ingredients. My dream is to bring families and communities together, one loaf at a time.
To make this dream a reality, I need help raising $20,000 to cover essential renovations and kitchen equipment to turn my garage into a micro bakery.  The cost for the oven alone is nearly $10,000 — more than I can manage on my own. This micro bakery is the key to turning my passion into a sustainable business, allowing me to provide for my family and give back to my community with real, nourishing food.
Your generosity- whether through a donation, sharing this campaign, or simply cheering me on-will help Millie’s Bread rise. Every loaf that leaves my oven will carry with it the love and kindness you've shown along the way.

As many of you know, I’ve been studying abroad in Uruguay this year—and it’s been everything I hoped for and more. The biggest reason? My host family. They’ve become my world and home away from home: two amazing siblings, a hilarious dad, and a powerhouse of a mom, Dary.
Today, I’m launching this GoFundMe to support Dary’s new business, El Silletero. It’s a vibrant celebration of Colombian cuisine, with her signature buñuelos (fried cheese balls that are honestly addictive) at the center. But this isn’t just about delicious food—it’s about a woman with vision, grit, and unstoppable drive.
Right now, El Silletero operates out of her home kitchen and at local ferias (street markets), where she sets up a stand and brings the flavors of Colombia to the heart of Uruguay. Her dream is to one day open a physical location—a space where people can gather, eat, and experience Colombian culture in full. I believe she’ll get there, and I want to help her take the next step.
Dary is a natural entrepreneur. She’s built businesses before, and she’s currently studying psychology at university,  taking courses in entrepreneurship, while also working in catering and raising three nearly-grown kids. Her days are packed, but her energy is contagious. She pours creativity, love, and hustle into everything she does—and El Silletero is no exception.
What makes this business even more special is the way it builds community. Through food, Dary is sharing Colombian culture in Uruguay—introducing traditions, flavors, and stories that spark connection and curiosity.
If you’re moved by her story, her hustle, or just the idea of supporting a dream that’s already changing lives (mine included), I’d be so grateful if you’d consider donating.

Your friendly neighborhood Witch Store and Lounge are losing their buildings, and we need your help!
We have been served notice to leave the buildings that have been the home of WitchLab and WitchLab Lounge. The landlord has stated that they plan to pursue an eviction due to a performance at the Lounge in early August, which they deemed a breach of our lease due to a fire element. Whether they plan to follow through with the eviction or allow us to stay the remaining few months on our lease (fingers crossed for this option), the result will be the same:
WitchLab is moving!
This is good news! It’s time for a change, and we welcome it. The timing is unexpected, as we had been in lease renewal negotiations for many months and were planning on staying, but that is no longer an option. The timing is also unfortunate as the bar has only been operating for a year and a half, which the building and development of was a financial burden that we had planned on spreading out over many years, and we do not have the resources to do it again so soon.
We love being a part of the many communities that welcome us, and we just aren’t ready to pack it in. So we’re putting out the call for help!
WitchLab needs you!
Here are some ways you can offer support:
* Spread the word! Whether by sharing our social media posts, this GoFundMe, or just telling all your friends! The more eyes and ears we get on this, the easier it will be to let everyone know that we’re relocating.
* Sign up to receive updates and/or lend a hand. We have a simple sign-up sheet that will make it easier for us to communicate news as we get it and keep everyone in the loop for any volunteer opportunities. And let's not forget about the celebration once we are settled again - you’ll definitely want an invite to that!!
https://forms.gle/dQZLUzp2BPWrsx37A
* Donate a little something to our GoFundMe. Anything at all will be helpful to us to be able to cover moving and restructuring expenses, legal fees, and all the stuff we haven’t even thought about yet.
We know you still have questions, so let us try to answer some of them here:
Where’s the new location?
Excellent question. We have a building in mind that we are hoping will fit all of our needs, and that is all we can share for now. We are keeping the rest under our hats until we know more. If you sign up to receive updates, you’ll be among the first to know! To sign up for updates, go here -->
https://forms.gle/dQZLUzp2BPWrsx37A
When is this happening?
We are hopeful that the landlord will allow us to stay until the end of our lease, in which case the move would be in early November. If they decide to pursue the eviction, that timeline is less in our control.
What happens if I have an event scheduled at WitchLab during this time?
We are working on keeping as many events on the calendar as possible while doing business as usual for as long as we can. If you have an event scheduled with us and would like to discuss what this might mean, please don't hesitate to contact us.",7692,46.0,"Font, Design, Graphics, Graphic design, Automotive Decal"

This project began because of my mom. She lived through an abusive relationship, and as a little boy, I wanted nothing more than to save her. Out of that longing, Project Yarrow was born. Something simple, powerful, and within reach at all times.
For the past year and a half, I've poured everything I have into inventing a safety device designed to protect people in danger of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking. It isn't just an invention. It's a lifeline. A way to give hope back to people who feel isolated. A way to help loved ones make it safely home.
But right now,
we're at a crossroads. Unless we raise $10,000 to secure our patent, we risk losing the ability to protect Project Yarrow and put it in the hands of those who need it most.

Will you help support me and all of these Goodest Boys and Girls in making our dream a reality?
I’m Savannah and I’ve been given the most special gift I could have ever asked for. My good friend Tami grew this incredible dog pack walking business from the ground up and when she moved to MA this Summer, she trained me to take things over and handed me the reins.
Pack walk is so much more than just a walk in the woods!! For the dogs that attend it’s The Best Day they could have while their most special humans can’t be with them. Our off-leash pack walks are a fun social way for your pup to get great exercise, as we hike, swim, romp and learn on over 100 acres of private land. These pups get to build and maintain friendships, gain confidence, learn new skills, and continue refining the skills they already have. The joy these pack walk adventures bring to the dogs that attend is undeniable. When your dog joins our pack walk adventures you can rest assured, knowing they’re living their very best lives even when you can’t be there with them.
I’m so incredibly honored to be the pack leader to these sweet pups. Everything these dogs love about pack walks; I also love about pack walks. It’s been such an incredibly huge source of joy for me throughout a very challenging time in my life. Earlier this Summer a few weeks before moving into a new apartment, and getting a divorce, I had a severe injury that required me to completely shut down my massage therapy practice for several consecutive months.
Over the last few months, a family I’m very close with has allowed me to temporarily swap cars with them twice per week so I can offer pack walks a few days a week.
Amongst all the big changes and challenges this past year has brought my way, these pack walks have helped me heal, and reconnect with the goodness this world has to offer. Leading these pups remind me to stay present, to be grateful for all the little things life has to offer, and to smile, play, and snuggle more!
In the time I’ve been able to offer part time pack walks a few things have become very clear:
1. We all want more pack walks!!! 2. I need the support of anyone willing and able to help me get this business fully launched.
Starting a business comes with significant costs, which has been hard for me to balance while needing to give my body time to heal from my injuries. While this pack walking  business may feel like all fun and games it does require a lot of things to be able to offer this safely year-round.
We are asking for
$30,000 in support
and the money will go directly into the costs associated with fully launching and expanding the My Best Life Dog Camp and Care business. The money will go towards expenses like:
*Purchasing a safe, reliable, large car to transport ten or more dogs
*Expenses associated with the car such as winter tires, fuel, gates to offer more containment and leashes in the car for dogs that need additional support in that way
*Long line leashes, land rental, poop bags (the landowners ask that we pick up after the dogs so as you can imagine we go through A LOT of poop bags!), tick spray for the summer, mushers paw for the winter, upgraded medical first aid kit, airlift for the dogs in case of injury while hiking
*Treats!!! The training we use during our pack walks is all positive reinforcement treat based training. This means we go through A LOT of high-quality treats from week to week. It’s incredibly important to not run out of treats during our walks as food helps the dogs feel safe and supported during our adventures. Treats also help to keep the pack close together, which is incredibly important in case of an emergency while on the trails.
Please consider donating whatever you’re able to help support me and all these beautiful dogs in living our very best lives.
If you haven’t seen pictures/videos of our adventures yet I encourage you to follow along on our Instagram page. You can find us at mybestlife_dogpack This page is another way these beautiful pups spread their joy out further into the world. Even if you don’t live close enough for your pup to join, you can still enjoy the happiness of their sweet little lives.

Megan built Hot Wood Arts from scratch 13 years ago in an 1860s warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn.  Hot Wood had 17 resident artist studios (including Megan’s) and 20 resident artists, a gallery and a performance space but it was much more than that. It was a vibrant community space where people came together to collaborate on a project, perform a concert, enjoy a show, build lasting friendships and spend time with like-minded people. Megan fostered a caring community at Hot Wood, something that is invaluable in these times.
Just last week, Megan hosted a phenomenal opening for a show by artist Simona Prives with sound art and music by Kyle Luntz and Ryan Vahey. Musicians David Nagler (As For the Future) and The Tall Pines performed sets of their fantastic original music. The opening was a memorable night of art and music, and community, something that occurred regularly at Hot Wood.
Tragically, on September 17th, a fire destroyed Hot Wood Arts and all of the art within it.  Megan puts so much energy into uplifting other people’s art and other people in general. Let’s come together and help her rebuild Hot Wood, cover the temporary loss of income, and show her that her community is here to help her rebuild.",35118,17.0,"Smile, Dog, Happiness, Fun, Fashion design"

Should one couple get to decide what’s right for an entire community? Island Brewing Company (IBC) brings people together through live music just a few hours a week—but now, it's under legal attack by a pair of wealthy part-time residents who simply don’t like it.
What’s Happening
This couple has launched a relentless campaign to shut down live music at IBC, despite overwhelming community support and a city council vote affirming the venue's right to host it. Now, they’ve escalated to a lawsuit—threatening to close down this popular local business.
They’ve called the Sheriff repeatedly (with no violations found) and are using their money and influence—from their primary home in LA—to try to silence a vibrant part of Carpinteria’s culture.
Why It Matters
IBC isn’t just a brewery, it’s a community hub run by locals, Paul and Cheryl Wright. They’re now facing steep legal costs just to keep their doors open. My wife and I have been coming here for 20+ years and we can’t stand by and risk the ruin of this invaluable community hub.
How You Can Help
Support this GoFundMe to help cover IBC’s legal defense. Let’s show that one couple’s money and status shouldn’t override an entire town’s voice.
Please share this fundraiser with your friends.
Donate whatever you can $10, $20 or more. Every little bit counts.
Defend our music. Defend our community. Defend Island Brewing Company.

Blatch’s Backyard BBQ, our beloved Salt Lake City staple of innovative vegan barbecue, suffered a devastating fire on Wednesday, September 3, 2025, following an unexpected medical emergency involving the chef-owner, Chris Blatchford.
While lighting a fire to begin his day, Chris experienced a Type I diabetic low blood sugar episode. In a scary moment, he passed out, awakening amid flames in the adjacent garage. Miraculously, he was able to crawl to safety. Though he sustained second-degree burns to his head, chest, and arms, Chris was treated and has since been released from the hospital.
The fire spread rapidly, fueled by six propane tanks that exploded, destroying over 80% of the restaurant’s equipment and leveling the garage space. As firefighters bravely battled the blaze—saving nearby homes and vehicles—their efforts contained the fire within 20 minutes, but the physical and emotional damage was done.
Blatch’s Backyard BBQ has always meant so much more than just food. Recognized as “Best Overall BBQ” in the 2025 Best of SLC Awards and glowing in a 5‑star Google rating, the restaurant stands as a beacon of creative, compassionate cuisine in our community  ￼.
Now, more than ever, they need us. Your generous support will help rebuild the kitchen, purchase new equipment, and restore this innovative spot that brings people together (and makes us rethink vegan BBQ). Let’s help Chris, his team, and our community restaurant rise from these ashes—stronger than ever.
How you can help:
•	Donate to support equipment replacement, repairs, and rebuilding efforts
•	Share this fundraiser with friends, family, and vegan/barbecue-loving communities
•	Send well wishes to Chris and the Blatch’s team—your encouragement means the world.
Thank you for helping turn tragedy into strength, and for supporting a business that’s rewriting what barbecue can be in Salt Lake City.",47883,32.0,"Emergency service, Emergency vehicle, Fire department, Emergency, Machine"

It’s been a safe, communal space where people can gather, talk openly, laugh, and feel like family.
But rising costs like rent, supplies, and everyday expenses have made it increasingly harder to keep the shop going without raising haircut prices. I’ve held off on raising prices because I know how important this space is, especially during these tough economic times.
Now, I need your help.
My goal is to raise $5,000 to cover essential shop expenses and improvements so the doors can stay open, and so the community that we’ve built can continue to grow.
Your support goes directly to keeping haircut prices affordable, maintaining the shop, and ensuring we have a place where everyone continues to feel welcome.
Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a huge difference.

BaSo opened their doors less than a year ago, offering regional Chinese cuisine. Inspired by childhood and travel memories, BaSo reflects the desire to treat Sonoma County to more innovative regional Chinese cuisine and to showcase the food Chef Sean always made for family meal, a communal occasion shared by restaurant staff before service. This past year,  a loyal following has been built in Sonoma County and BaSo has been recognized by Sonoma Magazine as ""Best New Opening"" and received a glowing review from the San Francisco Chronicle last week.
Imagine the flood of emotions as the community was notified that our beloved BaSo was on fire yesterday morning (Monday, September 22)! There are three tenants in the apartments above the restaurant and thankfully they are all safe and supported by the Red Cross. Our local fire districts were quick to respond and put out the fire before it reached the apartments.  What was once a place for locals to gather and share a meal, what our team called their home, vanished in a flash.
BaSo does have insurance, however this process is long. There are many tasks considering the inventory, replacement costs, investigations and insurance forms and approvals.  We want to show love to Jenny, Chef Sean and the staff  of BaSo and help them get back on their feet as soon as possible.
BaSo plans to have pop-up dinners to help support the staff and keep the spirit of BaSo, their home, alive.

As our slowest season of the year has arrived, we are once again asking for support to keep Peacefood alive. It is our mission to not only serve quality and affordable vegan food and desserts but also to raise the collective vibration with love and compassion for all. Many vegan restaurants in New York City have not been able to survive due to inflation and soaring rent prices, and Peacefood is still at high risk of closing. While we are immensely grateful to our loyal customers for continuing to choose Peacefood, we have still been unable to keep up with rent for several months. With your support, we believe we can overcome adversity and remain one of New York’s vegan strongholds.
Our restaurant is not only a space for eating plant-based cuisine. It is a space for all to find solace and compassionate care in a world that does not always put love first. At Peacefood, it is our goal to lead with love and build a space filled with positive energy. Every guest we have welcomed is part of our family, and we hope to continue attracting more like-minded individuals during our time of need. If Peacefood has had a positive effect on your life, we ask that you please spread the word so that more people can enjoy our all-vegan menu and delightful atmosphere.
There is great power in our Peacefood community, and we are calling for everyone to contribute so that we can keep our doors open for years to come. Whether you decide to donate to our GoFundMe, dine in at either of our locations, or order online, you are making an important impact on our beloved home. All of our staff and crew are thankful for your abundant support, and we look forward to many more years of prosperity to come.",13007,87.0,"Furniture, Restaurant, Chair, Food, Customer"

Happy Hearts exists today because of a shove from God. I felt called to create a safe, faith-based playcare where families, especially military families, single parents, and moms or dads who need trusted last-minute care, could find a loving village when they do not have relatives nearby.
We opened our doors on faith with very little funding, trusting that God would provide. And He has through the kindness of our community, the laughter of children in our indoor play space, and couples who came to our affordable Date Nights to strengthen their marriages.
Recently, an unexpected insurance FRAUD
left us suddenly uninsured and forced us to close temporarily. As a new small business already scraping by, this setback has pushed us loads behind financially, but we remain committed to the mission God gave us.
We are asking for $22,752.50 to help us get back on our feet and re-open quickly so we can continue serving families who rely on us:
•	$12,552.50 – secure proper business and liability insurance and pay the deposit/binder
•	$4,000 – recover lost payroll so our caring staff can stay with us
•	$2,900 – cover rent and utilities during the closure
•	$3,300 – replenish emergency fund!
Your gift, whether $10, $25, $50 or more, helps us reopen our doors and keep Happy Hearts available for parents who need safe, affordable care on short notice.
A Special Way to Support from Afar
If you do not live nearby but have family in the Cedar Point or Swansboro area, you can still bless them directly.
We offer Happy Hearts
Gift Certificates
that
never expire
and can be used toward drop-in childcare, Date Nights, or packages.
•	Grandparents can give their local kids a break and sponsor a few hours of safe, flexible care for their grandchildren.
•	Aunts, uncles, and friends can gift care hours for birthdays, holidays, or simply as an act of love.
Call to buy a gift certificate!
When you donate to this campaign, you are not only helping us reopen, you are helping us continue to be a village for the families you care about.
For Neighbors Without Kids
Even if you do not have children, your support matters. Happy Hearts is more than childcare; it is a community resource that strengthens local families, supports parents who work in essential jobs, and gives kids a safe place to belong. By helping us reopen, you are investing in the well-being of families who live and work right here in our area.
Every contribution helps us keep Happy Hearts as a safe, faith-filled space for children and a lifeline for parents who need last-minute care.
We believe God planted Happy Hearts to be a light for families who need a village. With your help, we can keep the lights on, literally, and continue that mission.
Thank you for standing with us to bring Happy Hearts Playcare back to the children and families who miss it most.

This wasn’t just any window — it was original 100-year-old glass that also carried our hand-painted shop sign, a piece of art that welcomed everyone who walked by.
Keep Time Barbershop is the definition of a small, local business. Six of us make our living inside this building, and over the years we’ve built great relationships with people from every walk of life. That’s why this loss stings so deeply.
Because of the age of the window, replacing the glass isn’t simple. The entire frame has to be rebuilt before new glass can be installed. On top of that, our custom sign — which was all hand-painted — will also need to be completely redone.
Unfortunately, insurance isn’t helping us cover this damage. After an already tough summer with several unexpected expenses, I’m not in a position to take on this financial hit alone.
Several friends and clients have encouraged me to set up a GoFundMe so the community has a way to pitch in and help. If you’re able to contribute, every dollar will go directly toward restoring the window and getting our sign repainted, so Keep Time Barbershop can look like home again.

Phase 1: Reopen Mohawk, Together
If you’ve ever stepped through the doors of Mohawk Place, you know the magic. It’s where strangers became friends pressed shoulder to shoulder. Where kids saw their very first show and left wanting to start bands of their own. Where legends and locals shared the same stage, night after night, leaving behind stories that became part of Buffalo’s DNA.
Mohawk Place has always been our stage—Buffalo’s stage. And right now, she’s silent.
When we took on this project, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. We’ve poured in every ounce of time, money, sweat, and heart we had—alongside an army of volunteers who carried lumber, painted walls, pulled cable, and gave their weekends so the lights might shine again. We’ve gone as far as we possibly can with the resources we have.
And the truth is: it’s not enough.
The building revealed challenges we didn’t know we’d be facing. More repairs, more code requirements, more unexpected costs than anyone could have imagined. We don’t say that with bitterness—we say it with honesty. Because despite it all, we are still here, still fighting, still believing in what Mohawk can mean for Buffalo’s future.
But to finish this job—to get the doors back open, to welcome the first wave of touring bands we already have lined up, to secure Mohawk’s future for the next 50 years—we need you.
Your support will go directly toward the essentials that make Mohawk safe, sound, and operational:
•    A new fire alarm system (required to open)
•    Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC upgrades to keep fans, artists, and staff safe
•    Stage and flooring repairs so the room can rock again
•    Hard-wired smoke and carbon monoxide detectors
•    Startup operational costs to keep the doors open and the music playing from day one
This isn’t just about fixing a building. It’s about preserving the soul of Buffalo music. It’s about ensuring there’s still a stage where the next generation of bands will cut their teeth, where lifelong friendships will be born, and where the legacy of every show that came before is honored in every note that rings out.
⸻
With Gratitude
To every volunteer who’s lifted a hammer, carried a speaker, painted a wall, or simply shown up for this cause: we see you, we thank you, and this is as much your story as it is ours.
To every person who’s about to donate: know that you’re not just giving money—you’re giving Buffalo back its heartbeat.
Let’s Do This
We are so close!
We’ve given everything we can. Now we’re asking Buffalo to meet us in this final stretch. Together, we can make sure Mohawk Place doesn’t just reopen—it thrives as a safe, sustainable, and community-driven home for music for the next 50 years and beyond.
Let’s keep the grit alive. Let’s make Mohawk Forever.

I finally took the plunge and
bought my first truck
. On the very first load, my truck broke down because the fuel stopped getting to the motor. I spent two days stranded on the side of the road until I was able to get a wrecker to tow me to a shop. They got it fixed within twenty-four hours. Three days later, I broke down again. Towed to a shop again. Monday, they looked at it and found the fuel system was contaminated. I couldn’t even get two loads completed since the truck was registered. Less than 3,000 miles altogether. Today, I received a repair estimate of $20,995. I’ve already dropped all my savings into getting this truck, getting it registered, and paying tow bills and hotel stays. Now I’m waiting to see if the dealership I bought the truck from and the previous shop are going to cover any of the repairs because algae has built up from the tanks all the way into the engine.
I’m already pinched with remaining bills for the month and bills are already going to start falling behind soon.
I’m just trying to get past this massive repair so that my dream of owning a truck doesn’t end before it has really even started.
It has been really stressful these last couple of days, especially in the last week. I left the house for my first load on the 12th and haven’t been home since. I’m trying to stay positive, but every turn makes the stress increase.

This is our home and we want to stay here forever.
The only way to promise that Hokie House stays here forever is for us to buy the building. Help us work towards that lofty goal. Together, we can truly ""Buy the Bar"".
Oliver Marques started working at Hokie House in the late 90’s as a line cook.  After leaving for a couple years to work for the Boys and Girls Club, he returned to Hokie House as a manager in August of 2003.  At that same time, Ish joined the staff as a bartender.  While Ollie was focused more on the back of the house, Ish focused on creating a better bar.  Introducing trivia, music bingo, and darts to the Hokie House over the years.
Together, Ish and Ollie worked for seven years before taking over ownership of the Hokie House in May of 2010.  Combined, they have 45+ years of service at the Hokie House!
The best thing about all of this is that both Oliver and Ish met their wives at Hokie House.  Several other employees and customers have done the same thing over the years, and it’s that link to the community that Hokie House loves the most.  It’s the type of love that has made Hokie House a keystone piece of Blacksburg’s identity since the mid 60’s.
Restaurants like the Hokie House face all sorts of financial hurdles including cost hikes, rent surges, and expensive equipment repairs.  To try and reduce some of these costs, the Hokie House is trying to purchase the property at 322 N Main St, but they need your help.
Please consider donating to their cause so we can keep the Hokie House where it is FOREVER!

Park Cafe is more than just a small deli cafe serving coffees, smoothies, and sandwiches—it's become a part of my life and a welcoming place for so many in our neighborhood. Over the years, many customers have become regulars and friends, and the cafe has grown into a community hub where people gather and connect.
Recently, I have been facing an unexpected crisis. My brother, who helped me with the business paperwork, suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. While caring for him and managing the cafe, I was unable to renew my lease in time, despite paying all accumulated rent, including during the difficult COVID period when the business was closed. Now, my landlord is trying to evict me, and I am at risk of losing my only source of income. I have reached out to the landlord’s office multiple times to resolve the lease issue, but have not received any help. I also tried to get assistance from pro bono lawyers, but they were unable to take my case.
I am urgently seeking funds to hire a litigation lawyer who can represent me in court and help me keep Park Cafe open. The legal fees are beyond what I can manage on my own, and I am facing possible eviction by the end of this month. Your support will go directly toward covering these legal costs and giving Park Cafe a fighting chance to stay in the community.

My wife, Sheri Boura, is an educator with 20+ years of teaching experience. We both share a passion for working with kids and making a difference in their lives. This passion has led us to opening our very own Math Learning Center in Chesterfield, MI. While we both have the passion and desire and energy and motivation to make this business thrive, we are in need of some financial assistance. We have quickly learned how difficult it is to start a brand new business, especially from a financial point of view. We have 3 children and, while our family has always gotten by just fine, we have never been very ""well off"" in terms of our finances. Initially, we were led to believe that we had been approved for enough money to start and open our business and have some working capital to get us through to profitability. However, that was just the beginning of our crazy funding journey. That initial lender was an investment capitalist group who pre-approved us for enough funds, but then later wanted us to lie about what we were using the funds for. Sheri and I were NOT okay with that and so we parted ways with them. We were then pre-approved by 2 different and separate lenders, only to later find out that they wouldn't handle a loan as low as what we wanted ($150,000.00). We then found a lender who WOULD handle our loan amount, but they turned us down twice, saying we were not asking for the correct amount. And at that point, we did not have our business space selected yet and were unable to accurately answer their questions about how much our construction was going to be, how much our rent was going to be, how much our utilities were going to be, etc. So then we ended up finding a company who helped us get our funding through a collection of personal and business credit cards at 0% interest. However, they were only able to get us a portion of what we wanted/needed and those 0% interest rates eventually end. Since then, we have pulled out nearly all of our own personal savings and investments to pay those down and keep our business going. We have also taken out a personal loan or two and have even borrowed against Sheri's 401k. And at this point, our credit scores have taken such a huge hit from everything, that it makes it extremely difficult to get approved for any type of consolidation loan or business loan. We have exhausted nearly every type of conventional lender possible and find ourselves in an extremely difficult financial situation. Meanwhile, in the time that we have been open and working with students, Sheri and I have fallen in love with this business. We have seen first hand how much of a difference we can make in young students lives! One of the tag lines from our business is ""Changing Lives Through Math"" and we are literally doing that every day! So we want nothing more than to continue this amazing, rewarding work and to continue making a difference for as many students as we can. We are doing everything we can to be active in our surrounding communities and school districts in order to give back while also spreading the word about our business, but we really just need some additional financial backing and a belief in who Sheri and I are and what we are doing! This business is so much more than just a way to make money for us. We are bound and determined to make this work and to be successful and to help change the lives of as many kids in our community as possible. So any and all help would be greatly appreciated. We are looking for upwards of $100,000 to pay off all of our existing debts from starting our business and to give us a bit of working capital.

Skowhegan hasn’t had a bookstore in over a decade, and I wanted to change that. I started small: shelves I built myself, secondhand books, a space where people could stop by, talk about what they’re reading, and find affordable books to take home. It’s become more than a shop; it’s a cozy gathering place for readers, artists, and neighbors who’ve missed having a spot like this in town.
Now that the weather’s turning cold, I’m raising funds to keep the shop going through the winter — to cover heat, lighting, insulation, and some basic improvements that will make the space safer and more welcoming. My dream is to expand just enough to host more community events — like our Radical Readers Book Club, craft hours, and story nights — and to eventually create a wheelchair-accessible entrance so everyone in town can feel at home here.
Every dollar helps keep the lights on, the space warm, and the books within reach for our community. Even if you can’t donate, sharing this campaign means a lot.
Let’s keep Skowhegan’s little garage bookshop alive — together.

Champions Liquor has proudly served this community for many years, becoming not just a business, but a place of unity and support. As part of our values, we have always stood firmly with Israel and displayed the Israeli flag in our front window as a symbol of solidarity and pride.
Unfortunately, our landlord at University Towers has informed us that our lease, which expires on January 1, 2026, will not be renewed. The reasons given are deeply troubling and discriminatory. Management has cited complaints, including one from a parent who expressed fear for her daughter’s safety solely because our business displays the Israeli flag. Additionally, they claim our flag violates lease terms, despite it being a peaceful expression of our identity and beliefs. We believe this to be an act of anti-Semitism and discrimination against our values and our community.
We are determined to continue our mission, to keep Champions in business, and to ensure that our Israeli flag continues to fly proudly. To accomplish this, we are seeking to raise $750,000 through our GoFundMe campaign. These funds will allow us to purchase, remodel, and relocate Champions to a new location, on the same block, where we can continue serving our loyal customers without fear of discrimination.
We are calling upon the good-hearted Israeli and Jewish community, as well as all those who stand against hatred and prejudice, to help us in this fight. With your support, we can overcome these challenges, preserve our business, and ensure that the values we stand for remain strong.
Together, we can stand against anti-Semitism and keep Champions thriving. Long live Israel, and may the truth and justice prevail.",16803,32.0,"Smile, Chin, Cheek, Happiness, Eyebrow"

On the outside, I was performing at the highest level. Inside, I was battling addiction I could not admit to anyone. That contradiction, thriving in business while secretly struggling, is the reality for many executives today.
After years of sobriety, I am launching a confidential coaching practice and proprietary framework, literature and potential podcast designed specifically for executives who feel trapped in that double life.
This is not theory. It is lived experience paired with leadership insight. My mission is to help leaders protect their sobriety, strengthen their performance, and find freedom without fear of exposure.
Of course, I wanted to keep this idea close to my chest until it was fully baked, but what I have learned is that my old “lone wolf” ways do not get me very far. Growth happens when I share openly and vulnerable regardless of my pride. Leaning on trusted people is the path forward, and that is why I am inviting you into this part of the journey now.
Why I Need Your Help
Launching this practice requires resources I cannot create on my own. In the past, I might have tried to white-knuckle it solo, but I've realized asking for help is strength, not weakness. Your support will give me the foundation to bring my vision to life and make it available to the people who need it most.
I am asking friends and colleagues who believe in this mission to consider contributions of $100 or more. These gifts provide the foundation for launching this practice and making it sustainable.
Suggested Giving Levels
$100 – Building Blocks
Supports website and branding so the coaching service looks professional and trustworthy to clients.
$250 – Outreach
Funds marketing outreach to connect with executives who are silently struggling and ensures they know this help exists.
$500 – Lifeline
Provides seed funding that allows me to dedicate time fully to developing this coaching practice and making it sustainable.
$1,000 – Legacy
Fuels the full launch of this work and establishes a strong foundation for long-term impact.
Closing
I have lived the double life of success on the outside and struggle on the inside. I know the shame, the fear, and the silence that keep so many leaders trapped. Sobriety gave me my life back, and now I want to use that experience to help others do the same.

We’re a small generational family-run homestead that’s always believed in hard work, community, and growing with care. We are Perma-culturists and believe in making your environment work for you.
We are dedicated to growing fresh greens, flavorful herbs, and raising happy, healthy poultry. Farming isn’t just our livelihood—it’s how we stay connected to the land and give back to our community.
This past summer was incredibly difficult. After years of hard work, we were finally starting to find our rhythm—until spiteful neighbors reported us to the Commonwealth of PA: Department of Manure Management and Animal Welfare. Although we were cleared after an investigation and found ""Not Guilty"", the damage was done. We lost critical time during peak farmers market season and, with it, a large portion of our income.
Now, we’re asking for your help to raise $10,000 to get back on our feet. Your support will help us:
Obtain Seeds and Bulbs for the following season
Buy Soil, mushroom fertilizer and blood meal
Replant our greens and herbs
Care for and maintain our tiny poultry operation
Buy equipment for our homesteading needs
Cover any fees to return to the farmer's market full time
We’re determined to rebuild and keep doing what we love—but we can’t do it alone. Every donation, share, or kind word brings us one step closer to a fresh start. There are lessons to be learned from each obstacle that is placed in your life. My lesson is to never let negativity win.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, our very existence has been driven to the brink, leaving me to ponder early retirement. Though we’ve lobbied and crusaded for substantial Health Insurance reform, the big behemoth insurance companies and those management companies they employ (partners in crime) continue to get away with murder (literally as well as metaphorically). What’s worse is they used our good name to recruit most of the remaining good plans into their rolls, further stripping us of our ability to offer our patients ethical state-of-the-art care.
Therefore, at the risk of shooting ourselves in the foot, we decided to cut ties with the worst of the bad actors while putting the others on notice that if they want to continue to have us as their provider, they must start flying right IMMEDIATELY. We’ve removed our practice from the panels of those whose top priority is to make money at the expense of appropriate patient care & small practices’ viability. There is no long game for these money-grubbing insurers and their management companies; they fleece the golden goose while they can, massaging their profits to attract even bigger mergers that award HUGE paydays for their execs & investors. I was offered such a deal by one attempting to lure us into their fold. But we’ll NOT sell out to legitimize these egregious practices.
Fortunately, there is light for us at the end of this nightmarish tunnel. We’re now contractually slated to be an inaugural exclusive specialty provider for a new big insurance management company that’s going live the 1st of 2026. Their backing will be huge and not subject to private support, and they’ll directly compete with existing companies, forcing them by comparison to shape up or lose out. We’ve also signed contracts with the VA for seamless scheduling of our brave Veterans (for which, as a Navy Veteran with 2 sons serving as active-duty Naval Officers, I’m VERY proud) along with a great new IEHP contract among many others. So, we expect 2026 will be a banner year for Riverside Eye Specialists!
That said, with the end of our Managed Care contract as of today and the anticipated fallout from our negotiations with these bad-acting insurance companies, we anticipate our dire situation will get worse before it gets better. At the risk of upsetting my friends, patients & colleagues, I’ve decided dire circumstances require dire action; I’ve decided to pass the hat, asking for Go Fund Me donations to not only keep the doors open, but to keep key staff from being poached by bigger practices by paying them competitive wages. Though I’ll be viewed by many as shameless and even just wrong, at this point there’s not much I’d NOT consider doing to save this practice from extinction. It goes without saying NONE of any $ we collect would be used for my use. Having drained all our retirement savings along with selling our Riverside home, the gains used to bolster the practice, we’ve gotten very comfortable living the austere life in our 1-bedroom apartment near the practice. We’re not looking for any large donations; please donate only if you support our cause and have the means to do so. And please understand, we'll not keep score; nobody should feel obligated to donate, we'll not treat ANY patient differently (as I'd like to think we've always demonstrated), and of course we'll continue our code of strict confidentiality for all patients and their records.

Eco-Librium Farm (ELF) is the culmination and just the beginning of my life’s work growing food and building sustainable ecosystems.  I started gardening with my mother around the time I could walk and my started my first job for a homesteading family at 16 years old. In college I tried to study broadly and looked for something different, but was always drawn back to study agriculture and ecology.
I believe that what is truly good for humans is also what is good for the planet.  From that comes a simple ideology.  Healthy People, Healthy Places.  Food should be good for you, taste great, and be good for the earth.
Eco-Librium is a small farm in Waynesboro VA nestled in the roots of the Appalachian mountains.  I started ELF in 2022 after 13+ years of agricultural experience in 4 different states and 2 separate countries (USA and Ireland).  I wanted the freedom to practice my vision for holistically sustainable agriculture that benefits all living things and honors our interconnectedness with the natural world.
The whole farm is a  total of 3 acres including my home with just under ¼ acre of good soil for vegetable crops, ½ to ¾ of an acre for blueberries and raspberries, and 2+ acres of forested hillside.  The land offers unique challenges and opportunities.  The many different growing zones–shaded dry understory, shaded wet ravine, forest edge, flat rich soil, and open rocky hillside–means there is limited possibility for scaling one crop, but it provides the opportunity for a richly integrated farm ecosystem that utilizes each area to its full potential.
Eco-Librium is dedicated to No-Till farming.  But a small compact utility tractor would help maintain the land and solve several key issues: 1) Clearing scrubby invasive plants for more fruit and herb plantings, 2) moving materials around the property, and 3) maintaining the driveway.
The beauty of a compact utility tractor is that once I have the tractor I can buy individual attachments over time. So while I can get a tractor and loader now to work on these specific issues, this purchase will continue to expand in usefulness over time and can grow with the business.
Invasive species remediation will take several years and a lot of hard work without chemical inputs.  Having a tractor to help with initial removal of larger trunks and brush and periodic mowing will make this possible.
In the long term I will continue to acquire useful attachments like pallet forks to be able to receive bulk supplies and equipment, a rotary cutter to keep the brush down, and woodchipper/shredder to  make my own mulch.
This tractor would support both economic success and environmental stewardship at Eco-Librium Farm.  Your funds will go directly to tractor payments and necessary attachments.  If Eco-Librium Farm aligns with your values I hope you will consider helping me build up my equipment!",1065,24.0,"Creative arts, Badge, Symbol, Fictional character"

What began as a road trip to a new home quickly grew into a legacy. By 1981, the family was working as equipment contractors for KFC, Wendy’s, and Burger King throughout the DMV. In 1987, after years of hard work in the restaurant industry, the Lloyds opened Chick N’ Friends in the Long Reach Village Center. Today, more than 24 years later, Chick N’ Friends proudly stands as the longest-running family-owned and Black-owned restaurant in Columbia, Maryland.
For decades, Chick N’ Friends has been more than just a place to eat—it has been a part of the community’s heartbeat. We’ve served comfort food that brings families together, offered first jobs and training to local youth, and provided a gathering place where memories are made.
Our family business has reached an important crossroads. With our lease ending and the property slated for redevelopment, it’s time for us to relocate. Taking to heart the feedback of our loyal customers, we’re excited to share that a new location has already been secured. Though this transition was unexpected, we’re optimistic—the new space will be safer, more visible, and better suited to welcome our community for years to come.
We’re so close to making this dream a reality! Our fundraising goal of $31772.00 will help us cover the final costs of relocating—everything from moving expenses to securing our new space and making sure the transition is smooth and successful.
But this move isn’t just about keeping things going—it’s also about growing! With your support, we’ll be able to expand our menu to include delicious breakfast options, a wider variety of desserts, a refreshing smoothie bar, and allow us to continue to offer employment to our community.
If Chick N’ Friends has touched your life, or if you believe in preserving community-rooted, family-owned businesses, we invite you to support us. Every donation—large or small—will help us keep the doors open and the tradition alive.

As her mom, I’ve watched Olivia pour her heart and soul into Rocketbelly since she was 10 years old. She saved every dollar, she worked harder than most adults, and she built a restaurant that people in Arlington truly loved.
I stepped away from my own career to support her dream because I believe in it as much as she does. But the truth is, the last year has been incredibly hard. We’ve faced obstacles that no child should have to endure just to keep a small business alive. On top of that, I'm a single mom providing for her and her two other siblings while trying to support her and keep her dreams alive.
Olivia signed a lease for her new location in Downtown Arlington last October. What should have been a quick transition turned into 11 months of delays and setbacks that were completely out of her control. We have shared more details on her social media pages. But below is a timeline of what happened:
She closed her original shop in May, expecting to reopen within weeks. Instead, she has been left waiting, first for a promised wall to be built, then for permits, then for electrical corrections. Each step has been slow, uncertain, and devastating for a 13-year-old who just wants to work hard and serve her community again.
At this point, Olivia no longer has a location, her savings have been eaten away, and Rocketbelly has been stuck in limbo. She has requested her prepaid rent and deposit back, but there’s no guarantee she’ll ever see those funds. That means she has to start over completely from scratch and this time without all the money she saved over 3 years of running Rocketbelly.
Olivia is only 13, but she has carried herself with strength and determination beyond her years. Still, even the strongest kids need help sometimes. I've exhausted all my family and emergency funds to try and help Olivia. That’s why I’m here, humbly asking on her behalf: if you’ve ever eaten at Rocketbelly, if you’ve ever cheered for a young entrepreneur, or if you just believe kids deserve the chance to see their dreams come true, please consider helping Olivia.

Here is a message from Olivia:
Hi everyone, my friends and awesome customers!! ❤️
I miss you all so, so much. Rocketbelly was my happy place, and the best part was always YOU — my customers, who became family.
It’s been really hard watching everything I worked for disappear while I sit and wait on things I can’t control. Some days it feels like my rocketship might never take off again. But I don’t want to give up, I just need a little help to get through this.
If you’ve ever enjoyed a meal, a tea, or a laugh at Rocketbelly,
I hope you’ll believe in me one more time
. Every dollar helps me get closer to reopening and welcoming you back.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I promise I’ll keep working hard, keep giving back to our community, and keep dreaming big.
Love, Olivia

Your support doesn’t just keep a business alive. It keeps a dream alive. It tells a young girl that her hard work matters, that her community believes in her, and that she can keep pushing forward no matter how many setbacks stand in her way.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for believing in Olivia, in Rocketbelly, and in the power of community

On October 6th, 2025, tragedy struck when our dear friends Alfredo and Nichelle Gonzales, the hardworking owners of
Elotes El Regio #2 in Corpus Christi
, lost their beloved food truck to a devastating fire.
In just moments, they lost everything inside the truck — equipment, supplies, and even personal belongings. For a family of six, this wasn’t just a business — it was their dream, their livelihood, and the way they supported their children and served our community.
If you’ve ever stopped by Elotes El Regio #2, you know the heart behind every roasted corn, taco, and plate they served. Alfredo and Nichelle always welcomed everyone with smiles, kindness, and the best Mexican food in town. They’ve built more than a business — they’ve built a family within our Corpus Christi community.
Now, it’s our turn to give back.
We’re asking our community to come together and help Alfredo, Nichelle, and their children rebuild what was lost.
Every dollar raised will go toward getting them back on their feet — replacing essential equipment, restocking ingredients, and helping them restart their dream.
Even a small donation can make a big difference. If you can’t donate, please share this fundraiser and help spread the word. Let’s remind this family that Corpus Christi stands behind them — just like they’ve always stood behind us with hard work, love, and delicious food.
Let’s help Elotes El Regio #2 rise again — stronger than ever.

Bringing more seats to the table with the breakfasts you crave and the baked goods you love.
Hello, my name is Stefannie Roundtree, and I am the proud owner and founder of Fannie Cakes™ Bakery Café. For the past eight years, I have had the honor of serving this community with fresh, homemade breakfasts, baked goods, and desserts that bring people together.
I am now stepping into an exciting new chapter: expanding into a new location directly next door. This space will finally allow us to provide seating for our customers, creating a warm and welcoming café environment where families and friends can gather to enjoy great food and fellowship.
To make this vision a reality, I am seeking to raise $10,000 through this fundraiser. These funds will go directly toward the essential costs of preparing the new café for operation, including:
Signage – to proudly display the Fannie Cakes™ name and attract customers
Inspections & Permits – to ensure the space meets all required health and safety standards
Rent – to secure the new location as we prepare for opening
Inventory – stocking the kitchen with the food and supplies needed to serve our customers
Cleaning & Preparation – making sure the café is spotless and inviting for our guests
Contractor Build-Out – finishing touches to the floor plan to ensure the space is customer-ready
My goal is to have the doors of our new café open by the end of October. With your support, we can make this happen even sooner.
This is not just about expanding a business—it’s about investing in our community, creating more opportunities, and continuing to serve the people who have supported Fannie Cakes™ from the beginning.
I invite you to join me in this next phase of our journey. Every contribution, big or small, will bring us closer to opening the doors of the new Fannie Cakes™ café. Together, we can make this vision a reality.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, encouragement, and belief in this dream.

But this journey isn’t just about starting a business. It’s about survival, resilience, and turning struggle into purpose.
For the past 13 months, my wife has been held off her federal work duties, fighting to get back into the career she loves. Just when she finally ordered too return, the government shutdown hit — knocking us right back into uncertainty. Through it all, I’ve been holding down our family of six, keeping the vision alive, and pushing forward step by step.
And here’s the part I’m most proud of:
I haven’t sat back waiting on a handout. I’ve already poured every resource and sacrifice I could into Starr Medical. I wrote a complete business plan, registered with the State of Tennessee, designed business cards, and even set up a company phone and fax line. I Have even started marketing, getting Starr Medical name out there to the community. These weren’t luxuries — they were faith moves, proof that I’m committed to making this dream real no matter the obstacles. Now, I’m at the final hurdle: covering the official LLC filing fees and startup costs to make Starr Medical fully official and open for business. This is where I need my community. By donating, you’re not just helping with paperwork. You’re Investing in a my children's future. Helping create real solutions for clinics so providers can focus on patients- YOU, not red tape.

Every donation, big or small, is a seed into something bigger than just me. It’s an act of faith that says: “I see you, I believe in you, and I want to be part of this story.” If you can’t give financially, a share is just as powerful. God told me I had no worries - so if a share is all i can get, then a share is all I will be thankful to have. Help me spread the word and bring this vision to life.

Hi everyone, my name is
Gavin Stella
, and alongside my partner
Nate Hilton
, we’re excited to share our new venture with you. We’re both students at
Eckerd College
, and with the school’s support, we’ve been given the opportunity to start our very own on-campus business:
selling Boba Tea to our fellow students.
We’re raising funds to cover startup costs like ingredients, supplies, and equipment to help us launch successfully and keep drinks affordable for our classmates.
Our stand is located in a
central spot on campus near the food vendors
, giving us great visibility and plenty of foot traffic. With very few drink options available on campus, we believe boba tea will quickly become a favorite choice for students looking for something refreshing and unique.
The closest competitor is a ramen shop about five minutes off campus, but since most Eckerd students live on campus without cars, we’re confident our location will make us the go-to spot for boba. On top of that, we’re running our business out of a
café-style lounge provided by the school,
which means
no residency costs
. That allows us to keep
our prices lower than competitors
while still offering the same great quality and making a
fair profit
.
Thank you for supporting us and helping bring something new and exciting to campus life.

Every day, I welcome children, families, and elderly guests who have become like family to me. I’ve always believed in serving healthy, affordable meals in a clean, welcoming environment, and I take pride in being there for my customers—whether it’s making a nutritious meal for a young person struggling with an eating disorder or checking in on an elderly couple when I notice a change in their routine. These moments remind me how much this restaurant means to the people around me, and how much they mean to me in return.
The past few years have been incredibly challenging. Food and supply costs have doubled or even tripled, and I’ve worked long hours—sometimes 65 hours a week—just to keep things going. Despite my efforts, I’ve fallen behind on rent and other essential bills like insurance and permits. I’m also facing a difficult decision about my health, as I’ve had to postpone much-needed back surgery because I can’t afford to hire extra help. My husband and I do everything we can, but it’s become overwhelming to manage these rising costs while still supporting my small team and serving the community I love.

If you would like, I can always ask them.
Summary: A large online retailer lost over $125,000 of our inventory, we had no sales for months, I covered salaries and expenses with savings and short-term loans. I have not paid myself since February. All donations will be used to pay off the short-term debt and buy inventory to support future operations. Your donations will keep 4 good people employed. It would be great to give the employees a bonus, they deserve it. Details below.
The longer version:
Hi, I’m Josh, and this is my story.
I don’t sleep well, the thought of closing the business puts 4 good people out of work and I wouldn’t be able to support my own child. But I get out of bed at 6am, put on my happy dad face and get my little girl ready for daycare. After the daycare drop-off reality sets back in and I know I have a problem. Now I’m almost to work and I put the happy face back on before the staff arrives.
We took a large loss in the first part of the year and I did what was necessary to keep paying my employees and keep the business afloat. The hole I dug seemed reasonable at the time, but here I am, asking for help.
We were approached by a very large retailer to supply them with inventory. But here is how that works: We send them inventory, then they sell it for us as they have a very large platform. So we own the inventory and they charge us to fulfil orders.
This was a very calculated decision. We tested them out over a year ago to make sure we understood the process and nuances. The process is very slow and there are plenty of nuances and getting help to fix issues is difficult. However, the visibility is tremendous, and we did sell a lot of items quickly. So we understood the risks but were ready. In order to be successful, we would need a large volume to be sent to their warehouse. So spent 7-8 months planning inventory (mainly apparel) and had a schedule to send spring / summer items in December and January to allow for processing time etc. and have our items on the website ready to go. We also sent a mix of fall/winter items as well.
What we didn’t anticipate:
The ability for a warehouse to lose 75% of our inventory in a short amount of time. We had not ran into this issue during our ‘trial’ phase. As it turns out, to report lost inventory there is a lot of paperwork involved to prove it was lost. We used their suggested shipping service, but still had to send them a pdf that a box of our inventory was delivered. We had to re-upload 100+ different inventory lists, then we had to go into their system to check our own status as we were not given any notification.
Long story short, 3 of us spent 5+ months checking in and submitting ‘help’ tickets. Since most of our inventory was lost, we weren’t selling anything on this large platform. We do have other outlets for sales, but couldn’t just pivot since there were only so many hours in a day.
I had hope we could fix the problem and bounce back. So I used my savings and took out loans to pay the employees, pay the bank, pay for daycare. For me, I went bare minimum. Thankfully I don’t have a lot of monthly expenses for myself. My car is 12 years old and has been paid off for a long time. I do get HBO MAX since it has Sesame Street and other Kids Shows and Movies.
Turns out, hope wasn’t a solution.
We really never received an answer on how it all happened. Thousands of emails that typically said “ we are working very hard on this.”
At this point I have minimal inventory and no reserves. Sadly I chose to borrow more money. I knew better. This is a viable business, it’s been in operation over 6 years. We have the ability to reallocate sales, but require the capital to purchase inventory and need time to ramp-up.
We are in a rural area and I am very fortunate to have a great staff. I do my best to be flexible with schedules and it had paid off greatly for me. I tell them all the time, just send me a text if you can’t make it in, I don’t need a reason, life happens, no worries here. They covered for me recently when my child’s eye doctor appointment lasted 4 hours and I greatly appreciated it. (Everything is fine with her eyes, the doctors’ office was just ‘running behind’ at 9am).
I’m 43, I struggled in my early 20’s after college to get a good job. I worked in corporate America for 20 years and saved as many pennies as I could. I didn’t plan to buy a women’s clothing distributor, but an opportunity presented itself and I took on the challenge of small business owner. It’s the happiest I’ve ever been at work. I went from suit and tie to forklift driver overnight. It’s hard to explain. I know I enjoy the challenges that arise daily, I enjoy teaching the staff about excel and the process of buying and selling. I tell you this, so the next part of my story has context on why all the warehouse workers are female.
Turns out, I don’t get many applications from males. Understandable. We get in shipments of women’s clothes and repackage to ship. I don’t particularly care, t-shirts are t-shirts, jeans are jeans. To me its all ‘product’ to sell.
Warehouse worker is the title, but a better title would be “we do everything needed.” I work the office, clean the bathroom and move boxes in the warehouse. The staff helps with office tasks, inventory evaluation and purchase, updating the website, answering the phone and emails…the list goes on and on (They move boxes too.)
(Names of Employee have been changed)
Cara is a single mom and often needs to take off to take care of her child. I will say her child needs more attention and help than most. She told me she took the job due to the flexibility. She had held other jobs where essentially, she was punished for needing to leave work to take care of her son in emergencies. Cara also gives Faye a ride to and from work daily.
Faye has been with me the longest. She works hard. I’ve helped her pay for car repairs but still she is currently without a working vehicle. She knows the warehouse better than me at this point. She is my go-to.
Sara works 2 jobs, a family and really digs into problems to solve them. She uses her own personal laptop (at home) to help me out when needed. I do work late hours, but I don’t expect anyone else to worry about that. So I learned a long time ago if I send Sara an email in the evening for a request, I wake up to a response she wrote at 10pm or 6am. I apologized to her, that wasn’t my intention for her to work that late or early, its just when I had time. Her response “I don’t mind, you let me take off whenever I need to, it works great for me.” ( I wasn’t going to argue with her, I just don’t send her late emails anymore.)
Dee is our newest employee. She started right before our big ramp-up to the retailer. She was hired mainly for warehouse work/clothes sorting etc. Very quickly she transitioned into being on top of the ‘help tickets’ for our lost apparel. She now is mainly in the office and really enjoys learning. She has been a great surprise with her willingness and attitude. She is exceptionally polite. She newer to the work-force and defies all stereotypes about work ethic.
That’s my story. I have not informed the employees as they have enough to worry about in their own lives. Greatly appreciate your help. If you would like a tour or want to learn how to drive a forklift, let me know.

We've looked at used projectors, new projectors and everything in the middle. Financially ($20,000) it would make sense to buy a cheap used projector but then we feel we will be in this same predicament in a few years time.
Ideally, for the longevity of the movie theater, we would love to be able to purchase as new of a projector as possible. This cost is looking to be about $55,000 (waiting to confirm delivery and set up costs).
We will be doing fundraisers and grant writing to help us cover some of this cost but we are also hoping you can help out too. We've heard so many heartwarming stories from our community that you are so happy the DeMarce Theatre has continued its long tradition of showhouse movies and we want to be able to continue this tradition for the next generations.

Local residents and long-time supporters of the Iola-Scandinavia community and surrounding areas, they wanted to give the community a fun and friendly place to go with family and friends, and provide top-quality food and drinks at prices folks could afford. The rest, as they say, is history. The Thirsty Perch is a staple in the community, drawing customers from all over to enjoy the atmosphere and the excellent food. Their Friday Fish Fry is one of the most popular in the area.
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Steve and Sherri saw an opportunity to bring even more to the community and purchased the auto garage that shared the driveway with The Thirsty Perch. The plan was to provide a venue for everyone to come and enjoy live outdoor music by converting the garage into an awesome outdoor bar with plenty of seating and even bathrooms. The end result is a beautiful outdoor space that over the years has drawn many visitors to Iola for a variety of music, events, and performers.
The first live music performance was on Memorial Day weekend in 2021 when Spicy Tie Band took the stage and rocked the crowd to everyone’s delight. Since that first show, The Perch has hosted almost 200 bands, and the audience and popularity of the venue grow with each performance.
The Thirsty Perch typically employs 25 full and part-time staff members, and in the summer that number increases to 35. These are local community members, many of whom are in high school or college, and the money they earn at The Thirsty Perch, both salary and their tips, helps pay their way through school. People who need a second job are able to work at The Thirsty Perch in the evenings and on the weekends to help support their families. People who are retired and are looking for a little extra income or just want to get out of the house are also able to help fill those odd shifts. No matter how you look at it, The Thirsty Perch brings significant revenue into our village, both from customers at the establishment and those who visit other local businesses as a result of coming to The Perch.
On June 10, 2025, with no warning whatsoever, The Village Board voted to not renew the liquor license for The Thirsty Perch. Despite being a respected and popular restaurant, losing the liquor license will essentially put The Perch out of business. The foundation for this decision was an open court case Steve was working through and in no way impeded his ability to participate in or own a bar and restaurant. Since this injustice, Steve prevailed in court and the charges were either dropped or reduced, making this situation even more tragic and unfair.
Steve and Sherri vowed to fight this shocking injustice and have hired attorneys and are working through the appeal process, now at the state level. They are fighting for their dream, they are fighting for their livelihood and they are fighting to continue to be a strong supporter ofand contributor to our community.
The impact of this on both their business income and personal savings is shocking and the reason for this fundraiser.
Lost business revenues: $80,000
Personal funds spent on attorney fees: $37,000
The Thirsty Perch and Steve and Sherri need support from the community to which they have dedicated the last 7 years of their lives.
Their personal savings are depleted, and this battle is not over. We are appealing to everyone who, whether a customer of The Thirsty Perch, a friend of Steve and Sherri, a former employee, or just someone who is troubled by the wrong that has been done to these people… we need your help. Any amount that you can donate will be applied directly towards the legal costs incurred by The Thirsty Perch as they fight to regain their liquor license and become the wonderfully popular, vibrant business that we have all come to know and love. Please donate any amount that you can and know that no amount is too small and every little bit helps.

For over 25 years, walking has been one of my biggest challenges. Every step carries the risk of falling. While most people don’t notice an uneven sidewalk, dips in the grass, or rocks on the pavement, these things quickly become a serious hazard for me.
Still, I refuse to let MS sideline me. Every day, I push forward with determination, committed to staying active because movement is key to a thriving life. Walking, even with its risks, is essential not just for mobility, but for independence, connection, and joy. I’ve spent years searching for ways to move safely and confidently, refusing to let fear hold me back. Out of that determination, the Steady Buddy was born.
What is the Steady Buddy?
The Steady Buddy is a simple, wearable walking aid that helps people walk side by side with confidence and freedom. It’s a soft neoprene armband that is tightened on the upper arm with two Velcro straps and a sturdy handle is attached. One person wears the Steady Buddy and the other holds the handle. Together, you walk with ease and steadiness. Unlike bulky canes or walkers, it’s discreet, comfortable, and designed to make walking about companionship instead of fear.
My
Journey
Developing the Steady Buddy has been a labor of love. I’ve invested years of work, personal time, and resources to bring this vision to life.
•  Patent pending
•  Trademark registered
•  Entirely developed, funded, and led by me
Your Support
Your support at this critical time will go directly toward manufacturing, distribution, and getting the Steady Buddy into the hands of those who need it most. Together, we can make walking safer, more joyful, and more connected for people living with MS and other mobility challenges.
Thank you for believing in this vision and helping bring the Steady Buddy into the world. If this mission speaks to you, please share it with your family and friends. Together, we can bring safety, confidence, and joy to more people who need it.",8561,36.0,"Smile, Eyebrow, Happiness, Skin, Facial expression"

Many people may know or heard of it, “The Shoe Repair.”
The Shoe Repair was one of multiple shoe repair shops to open in the Chapel Hill, NC university area. Cindy took over the shop sometime in the early-mid 90s. Not only did she have customers from all over the Chapel Hill-RDU area, but out of the state as well. She has repaired shoes for the well known. For Woody Durham, Carl Fox, Henry Gates, Phil Ford, James Sperling, Sylvia Hatchell and the list goes on.
As her kids, grandkids, and great grands grew up, our first job was at The Shoe Repair so that we could learn the skills of running a cash register and what it takes to repair shoes. Till this day we’re able to come in and help take the load off sometime. She would NEVER turn down a customer! She would always try her best with everything that was brought to her from shoes, purses, backpacks, belts, the list goes on! Cindy Riggsbee is well known in the Chapel Hill/ RDU area, not only for repairing shoes but for being the kind, loving, helpful woman that she is.
Owning the Shoe Repair and repairing shoes brings Cindy so much enjoyment. She has befriended so many. She might not remember their names but she knows they are her customers. Cindy does to shoes what our Saviour, Jesus Christ does to us. We are torn, low to the ground, and feel like we have no more use but, through prayer and faith, Jesus repairs us. He Gives us new strength and stability to carry on. Cindy knows this. She told a customer to come back in a few weeks. She will be open. Cindy has her faith in Jesus.
Unfortunately, her insurance will not be able to cover all of the repairs that are needed to rebuild the shop and get it back up and running. Her family has gathered together to make a go fund me account to help raise money, to help her with repairing the shop. We just want to thank everyone in advance with any donation that she may receive, we greatly appreciate it and it will mean so much!

My name is Shawayne Robinson, me and my spouse ( Disabled Vet ) have always dreamed of sharing our love for Caribbean dishes with the community. A food truck is the perfect way to make that dream come true bringing fresh, delicious meals straight to neighborhoods, events, and local gatherings.
Why a Food Truck?
Opening a restaurant can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, but a food truck allows me to start smaller while still serving high quality food. We want to create not just meals, but an experience that brings people together through flavor, culture, and community.
How Donations Will Help
Your support will help cover essential startup costs, including:
• Purchasing and outfitting the food truck
• Kitchen equipment and safety requirements
• Licenses, health permits, and commissary fees
• Initial inventory and supplies
•	️ Insurance and marketing
My Goal
We are aiming to raise $60,000 to help get the truck on the road and serve the community. Even the smallest donation makes a huge difference.
How You Can Help
•	Donate what you can every dollar helps!
•	Share this campaign with friends, family, and on social media.
•	Come visit the truck once it’s up and running I’d love to serve you a plate of our delicious meals
Thank you so much for supporting our dream. With your help, We can turn this vision into a reality and bring flavorful food to life on wheels!

This bar was never just a bar. It was a heartbeat. A sanctuary. A stage for the stories that music tells when words fall short. From the first chord struck on our tiny stage to the last drink poured after a midnight encore, we’ve held space for the dreamers, the drifters, the lovers, and the loners. You made this place magic.
We’ve fought hard to keep these doors open—through long hours, personal sacrifice, and unwavering love for what this place has meant to so many. We’ve tried every angle, every pivot, every prayer. But sometimes, even the most cherished places need a lifeline.
So I'm turning to you—my community, family, and fellow believers in the power of music and connection.
If this bar has ever been your refuge, your rhythm, your reason to dance… we need your help.
Your donation will go directly toward keeping the lights on, the speakers humming, and the spirit alive. Every dollar is a note in the song we’re still trying to play.
We’re not ready to say goodbye. Not yet. Not while there’s still music to be made, memories to be shared, and stories waiting to unfold beneath these dim lights and worn floorboards.
To every patron who ever walked through these doors: thank you. You brought life to these walls. You made this more than a bar—you made it a home. Your stories, your celebrations, your quiet moments at the counter… they mattered. They still do.
If we must close, we’ll do so with grace. We’ll offer up pieces of the space that might find new life elsewhere—from bar stools and glassware to vintage signage and décor. These items carry the spirit of what we built together. But if there’s a chance to keep the beat going, I'll take it.
Being part of your lives—and witnessing what music can mean to the soul—has meant more to me than you’ll ever know. In this life or the next, I hope the beat goes on.
With love, gratitude, and hope,",6460,13.0,"Font, Graphics, Graphic design"

23 years ago I went on stage for the first time and gained a confidence and a passion for theater that I didn't know I could have at 12 years old.  Coming out of that experience I knew what I wanted to do with my life- I wanted to do theater.  But I didn't have dreams of going to Broadway, or Hollywood- Right then, at 12 years old, I KNEW I wanted to give other children this same experience I had of fun, creativity, expression, confidence and to see themselves as more capable than they dreamed possible and to know they belonged.  I decided that when I grew up I would open a children's theater.  I pursued a degree in Theatre Education (K-12), in 2012 I volunteered with Americorp in Teach for America in Mission Texas teaching middle school drama and  flash forward to 2016 pregnant with twins in Jefferson City Missouri- I knew it was time to open my children's theater.  In the past 9 years, we have put on hundreds of productions of various scale and skill, we teach 3 year olds to be brave, 4 year olds to be creative, 5 year olds to follow directions, 6 year olds to memorize, 7 year olds to challenge themselves, 8 year olds to accomplish hard things, 9 year olds to be leaders, 10 year olds to plan, 11 year olds to create, and 12 year olds to direct- and the education and experience gained from theater just keeps building, evolving and polishing these amazing little humans to be able to see everything they actually are and can be.
We are now about to enter our 10th year of producing theater for young audiences and by young performers. We love our students, their families and all of the support we have received from our community.  In an effort to stay accessible to all children of all demographics and incomes we have kept prices very low and worked budgeting magic to accomplish all we do. We are now hoping to create sustainability in our operation, more than anything we would like to have a permanent home for itsy Bitsy Broadway.  Please consider helping Itsy Bitsy Broadway continue to offer affordable theater experiences for all children and find a permanent home by contributing to our Go Fund Me- we promise to keep giving theater to the children and we promise to never grow up <3",1775,20.0,"White, Line art, Drawing, Design, Graphics"

This fundraiser will help us bring this dream to life, an offering to the city we love. While we’ve invested our own savings, we’re calling on our community to help us cross the finish line. Your contribution will support renovations, permits, a liquor license, and legal/administrative costs to lay the groundwork for a lasting, community centered venue.
We are an Oakland-based power-house team with a shared commitment to cultivating spaces that inspire connection, celebration, and self-expression. One of us brings over two decades of experience in bar leadership and community programming. The other is a celebrated DJ and curator known for music-driven experiences that unite generations and backgrounds. We bring a rare combination of experience, blending industry knowledge, cultural insight and deep community roots.
We've chosen to name the venue Golden Ratio. It's a name that reflects our philosophy and is a natural blueprint found in everything from seashells to symphonies. It's the sweet spot where music slaps, cocktails hit right and community feels real.
Together, what we're creating encompasses everything we’ve built across the Bay. This is more than a business, it’s a continuation of our work, rooted in care and shared purpose. With your help, we’ll create a space where people come as they are and leave more connected.
No matter the amount, every contribution brings us one step closer to opening our doors. Whether you’re giving $10 or $10,000, your support means the world to us — and we’re so grateful to be building this space with our community behind us.

For the past four years, Melrose House has been a community space where DJs, artists, and collectives have been able to host events, build culture, and bring people together.
Recently, we invested in remodeling the venue to improve the space for everyone. Before starting the remodel, the landlord and I had an agreement: he would renew the lease at the same rent for two more years if we moved forward with the improvements. I have his word in writing through text messages, but he never sent the formal amendment. Now that the remodel is done, he’s trying to raise the rent and telling me “things change.”
I used my personal savings to upgrade this space, and as many of you know, small venues like ours are struggling to survive. We want to stay open and continue providing a home for events, music, and community.

Hi friends! We’re Kevin and Esprit Herbert, the owners of Herbert Sherbert Ice Cream Co. in Brooksville, Florida.
For the past 7 years, we’ve been serving up our retro, colorful ice cream all across central Florida with mobile carts and events — and now we’re ready for our next big step!
Our current space is changing hands, so we’re relocating quickly — and that means BIG things ahead: a brand-new commercial kitchen (we have several businesses that will be moving with us who use our commissary) and, soon, a storefront where you can come hang out, grab your favorite scoops, and experience the Herbert Sherbert vibe in person.
We’ve worked hard and bootstrapped this business, since the very beginning (right before the pandemic)
We've weathered every storm, taken every risk imaginable and we've enjoyed every moment and scoop with YOU.
We are so thankful for the community that we have around us.
And now, we need YOU.
Whether it’s through fundraising, sharing our story, or simply cheering us on, your support makes all the difference.
Now, for the specifics:
Our build out is going to cost us: $17,000
Construction must begin on October 16th, this month.
As of now, we are $9,500.00 away from ensuring that the construction goes through smoothly in this short time frame along with the relocation of our wonderful renters.
Any and all assistance will not only make us even more grateful than we are for your continued belief in our business, but will also be used to to bless each and every business and every friend who loves our Sweet Treats.
We will make it worth your while ❤️
And we will show you how we're going to do that each and every step of the way, you will all be watching moment by moment, as we BUILD THIS DREAM TOGETHER ✊",1650,6.0,"Clip art, Graphics"

For more than 20 years, God has been preparing me for this moment. From wiping down equipment at Gold’s Gym as a teen, to managing gyms, to training clients, and finally running my own Christian health coaching business—I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the broken sides of the fitness industry.
Now, I’m stepping out in faith to open Fit Church in Hampton Roads.
This won’t be just another gym. It will be a Christ-centered fitness community where the Gospel is woven into everything we do—where believers can grow stronger both physically and spiritually, and where our community finds a safe, uplifting environment to pursue health.

BLAZE was built on the belief that fitness isn’t just about sweating, it’s about community, connection, and transformation. Since opening our doors, we’ve created a space where people come together to move, heal, grow stronger, and find joy. From high-energy cycling parties to grounding yoga flows, from beginners to seasoned athletes, BLAZE has welcomed everyone.
Unfortunately, a freak accident changed everything. A car hit and ripped off the back door of our building, which led the city to deem our space unsafe until new doors could be installed. We were only opened barely three weeks when this happened. While we’ve worked to keep the spirit of BLAZE alive with pop-up and in-home classes, this setback has taken a huge financial toll. We’ve been struggling to keep up with rent, utilities, and studio expenses while waiting for repairs, and the reality is we need help to keep BLAZE’s doors open.
This fundraiser will go directly toward:
•	Covering rent and utilities while the studio recovers
•	Repair and safety expenses from the accident
•	Keeping BLAZE alive for the members and community that call it home
BLAZE isn’t just a fitness studio, it’s a safe haven. It’s where people discover their strength, find support, and realize they are capable of more than they thought possible. I’ve watched members grow in confidence, crush goals, and even find healing in their bodies and minds. That’s why I believe so deeply that BLAZE matters, and why I’m asking for your help today.
If BLAZE has inspired you, supported you, or simply made you smile, please consider donating or sharing this campaign. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a difference in helping us keep the fire burning.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for believing in BLAZE and being part of this journey. Together, we can keep the flame alive.

My name is Nicole, and I’m the owner of The Brass Owl in Queens, NY. After 14 years in corporate retail, I followed my family’s tradition of small business ownership and opened The Brass Owl in 2014. At the time, Astoria didn’t have many fashion boutiques that catered to our diverse community, and I wanted to create a welcoming, friendly space for everyone.
The Brass Owl has always been more than a shop to me. Over the years, it’s become a hub for local artists, families, and neighbors. We’ve hosted artist pop-ups, co-chair the Destination Ditmars Merchants Association, organized small business crawls, and supported local organizations. For me, it’s always been about more than selling products, it’s about building community.
Unfortunately, like many small businesses, the past 2 years have brought challenges we couldn’t have predicted.
Rent and expenses have increased significantly
Tariffs and shipping delays
And most recently, a big-box retailer opened just around the corner, drastically reducing our foot traffic
Despite these obstacles, we’ve worked hard to keep prices fair and to continue supporting our community. So, we are reaching out to the community we love so much for help to give us a chance to make it 2026.
This fundraiser will help us:
Cover rent and utilities to keep our doors open
Support payroll for our amazing team
Pay local makers and artists whose goods fill our shop
Invest in events and outreach to bring our community back together
Make store improvements to meet our customers’ needs
How You Can Help
1.	Donate what you can - no amount is too small*
2.	Share this page with friends, family, and neighborhood groups to help spread the word.
3.	Shop with us in person or online - every purchase keeps us going.
*And to thank you, bring your GoFundMe receipt in for a free gift (in store only).
I want to be transparent: this fundraiser is truly our hail mary. I can’t guarantee it will solve every challenge, but I do know that without trying and without asking for help from the community we love , The Brass Owl won’t have a fighting chance. Every dollar, every share, and every purchase gives us hope and brings us closer to keeping our doors open.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for standing by us during this difficult time. This neighborhood has given me so much, and I hope with your help, The Brass Owl can continue to give back for many years to come.
❤️,
Nicole & The Brass Owl Team

A year and a half ago, I started a dream: a philanthropic coffee business that not only served delicious, high-quality (fair trade and organic) coffee but also fueled life-saving animal rescue work.
From the start, WilsonHaus Coffee had a simple mission:
☕ Every bag sold helps fund our animal rescue, WilsonHaus Rescue, which focuses on saving dogs from euthanasia lists and assisting our collaborative partners to pull horses out of the slaughter pipeline.
$1 from every bag is ALSO set aside specifically for spay and neuter clinics in parts of America where stray and street dog populations overwhelm shelters. These clinics are run in partnership with “boots-on-the-ground” rescues who host pop-up events to humanely reduce overpopulation and suffering.
It was working. It was growing. It was changing lives.
⸻
Why We Paused — And Why We’re Ready to Begin Again
Last year, just as we moved into the building for our rescue, my life was turned upside down.
The very day we opened WilsonHaus Rescue’s doors, a personal trauma upended my stability.
I was suddenly navigating a major life change, a move, and the challenge of running a brick and mortar dog rescue.
The funds I had saved to grow WilsonHaus Coffee went toward keeping our rescue afloat and keeping myself going.
I poured all of myself into the rescue. I didn’t think about my own stability. Now, I am choosing to focus on THIS and how to rebuild not only my dream of having this successful business but also give back in bold and beautiful ways.
⸻
Why GoFundMe?
I didn’t want to take on interest-bearing bank loans. I believe in the power of community funding — where people come together to make something beautiful possible without the strings of debt attached.
This started as a grassroots effort on Venmo, but for security and transparency, I’m moving to GoFundMe. Here, you can watch the progress bar climb in real time and see the impact of your contribution.

I’m reaching out on behalf of my mom, Lorrie — the heart and soul behind Riverbend Pizza & Steakhouse. Many of you know her for her kind soul, delicious food, and the love she pours into our local community through her restaurant.
Today, she needs our help.
What’s Happening
Riverbend has been a beloved part of Keosauqua for many years. My mom’s dream of owning a restaurant came true when she moved to Iowa in 2018 and she’s been working tirelessly ever since to serve this community.
Recently, she began the process of moving Riverbend to a new location — the former First Street Bar & Grill — with plans to transition slowly after renovations and upgrades were complete. Unfortunately, these needed renovations have taken longer than anticipated, and the current lease is up October 1st.
Now, she’s in a race against time — and money — to keep her dream alive.
️ Why We Need Help
The sudden timeline means everything has had to happen fast:
•	Renovating the new space
•	Purchasing and installing key equipment (like a pizza oven)
•	Covering unexpected moving and construction expenses
•	Keeping Riverbend open and running in the meantime
My mom, her staff, friends, and family have been working around the clock — doing everything they can to stay afloat. But it’s just too much to do alone, and the costs have far exceeded what was originally budgeted.
Looking Ahead
With the Fall Festival coming up — the busiest weekend of the year — there’s real hope. If Riverbend can be up and running by then, it would go a long way toward getting caught up on bills and stabilizing the business again.
How You Can Help
Anyone who knows my mom knows how hard she works and how deeply she cares. She never asks for help, so I’m asking on her behalf:
If Riverbend has ever meant something to you — a meal, a memory, a moment — please consider helping.
Every dollar will go directly toward keeping the doors of Riverbend open, finishing the transition, and ensuring it remains a place of community for years to come.
Ways to Donate
•	GoFundMe – via this page (small processing fee)
•	Direct donation – for 100% of your contribution to go to Riverbend, you can drop off donations at the restaurant or send via PayPal.
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. We’re so grateful for this community, and I promise my mom will continue giving back in every way she can — just like she always has.
Please feel free to reach out to me personally if you have any questions.
With gratitude,

A Place of Beauty in an Unexpected Space
Between two industrial warehouses, an overlooked courtyard will be transformed into a place alive with greenery, water, and light. The backdrop of steel and raw wood will frame the real stars: lush plants, artfully weathered pottery, and the gentle trickle of fountains. At the center will stand a greenhouse-like structure built from salvaged wood windows, a striking focal point that ties the space together. Inside, visitors will find quality hand tools, organic soil amendments, heirloom seeds, and a curated selection of garden gifts and goods.
Storytelling will be woven into every corner. Creative signage will share not just plant names, but how they support pollinators, restore habitat, or thrive in Oregon’s climate. We want every visitor to feel they have stepped into a space that is unexpected, unforgettable, and timeless.

Later, as a Marketing Team Leader at Whole Foods Market, Lee honed skills in storytelling, merchandising, and customer engagement that continue to shape his work today.
At
Durant at Red Ridge Farms
, Lee led a comprehensive rebrand that united four distinct businesses into one nationally recognized destination for wine, olive oil, specialty nursery plants, and culinary tourism. Over eight years, he expanded a small two-day olive oil celebration into the Olio Nuevo Festival, a month-long annual event that draws visitors with its focus on local food, wine, and culture. Under his leadership, Durant became a “must-stop” in Oregon wine country, recognized as an industry leader while achieving rapid growth in both visitation and sales.

Why It Matters
Berry Creek Garden
is more than plants on shelves. It is a hub for sustainable gardening, a platform for education, and a respite in the heart of McMinnville’s growing Granary District. By growing much of our own stock in a retrofitted greenhouse at Tainable Labs, we will provide healthy, locally cultivated plants that are not shipped in from hundreds of miles away. By curating native species and teaching practical gardening skills, we will help people create yards and habitats that are as good for the planet as they are beautiful.
Every purchase supports local ecosystems.
Every class makes gardening more accessible.
Every event gathers people around beauty and sustainability.
With your support, Berry Creek Garden will take root and grow into something extraordinary.

For over 30 years, the Travelers Inn Motel has been more than just a place to stay—it’s been a home away from home, run with heart, grit, and hospitality by the Bryant family.
Nestled along a quiet stretch of highway, the Travelers Inn has welcomed road-trippers, truck drivers, families, and folks just needing a place to rest their heads. Many of our guests come back year after year—not just because of the comfy rooms, but because of the people behind the desk: the Bryants.
This past year, though, has been the hardest the family has ever faced.
Between unexpected storm damage, rising repair costs, and fewer travelers coming through town, the Bryants have been stretched thin trying to keep the doors open. They’ve used every bit of savings to patch the roof, fix plumbing issues, and keep the lights on—but it’s not enough.
Now, they’re humbly asking for help.
What We’re Raising Money For:
Critical roof repairs before the next rainy season
Room updates (beds, flooring, paint) to meet modern standards
New signage and exterior lighting to help travelers find the motel safely at night
Basic operating costs (utilities, supplies) to stay open through the winter
The goal isn’t to become a luxury resort—it’s to keep a piece of small-town America alive. Travelers Inn is one of the few remaining family-owned motels in the area.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to share something deeply personal and important to me: the journey of Shugaland, a dream I’ve been building that is now becoming a reality.
When we launched Shugaland, our vision was simple but powerful: to create a trusted, transparent, and data-first real estate experience for Nigeria and Africa. Buying property has long been riddled with uncertainty, fraud, and inefficiencies. We believe it shouldn’t be that way. Everyone deserves peace of mind when making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives.
Our Journey So Far
•	From our initial launch, we’ve seen strong product adoption, connecting early users with verified agents and developers.
•	We’ve had the privilege of guiding customers through safer, more transparent real estate transactions.
•	We’ve already onboarded trusted partners and begun to see the spark of what a data-driven ecosystem can do for buyers, sellers, and diaspora investors alike.
About the Founders
For those who may not know the founders have extensive professional experience and they’ve spent over a decade working as a technology architects, product managers and executives, helping companies solve complex digital challenges. But Shugaland is more than just a business for them—it’s a mission to solve a real pain point in our society and to build something that will last for generations.
Our Roadmap Ahead
We are just getting started. In the coming months, Shugaland will:
•	Expand our CRM and KYC technology to make every transaction more secure.
•	Build analytics and insights tools to empower customers and agents with real data.
•	Strengthen our marketing reach, so more people—both at home and abroad—can find trustworthy real estate opportunities.
•	Continue building a community of verified agents and partners, ensuring quality and safety across every touchpoint.
Why This Matters to Us
We’re passionate about this because real estate isn’t just about buildings—it’s about trust, safety, and opportunity. Nigeria and Africa are entering a new era where data and transparency will define the winners. We want Shugaland to be at the forefront of that transformation.
How We’ll Use the Funds
The support we’re seeking from close friends and family will go directly into:
•	Improving our technology platform, scaling its reliability, and adding more data intelligence.
•	Expanding our marketing efforts, so we can reach more buyers, sellers, and diaspora investors who need trusted solutions.
This is a heartfelt invitation to join us on this journey—not just as supporters, but as partners in creating a new future for real estate in Africa.
With gratitude,

The cause of the fire was never determined. The fallout was massive - literally every possession I owned - including the clothes I was wearing at the time - were consumed. The damage was not limited to material items - I was also injured (thankfully, I was the only person to sustain physical injuries). Shortly after the firefighters arrived on the scene, I was taken by ambulance to Frye Regional Medical Center, and then flown, in short order, by helicopter to the Wake Forest Baptist Burn Center/Intensive Care Unit. I spent the next 30 days in that unit, and underwent more surgical procedures than I care to recall. I was put on a ventilator for two weeks because I could not breathe on my own due to smoke inhalation; my thumb and index finger were amputated from my dominant hand because their bones had been burned through; multiple, large skin grafts were required to treat the third degree burns that covered my left side, arm, hand, and head. Thanks to God and to the amazing medical care I received, I was able to escape with my life. It could have been so much worse.
The rehabilitation process has been long and challenging. The surgical procedures did not stop after I left the hospital. I think that I have been operated on something like two dozen times now, and there have been complications, infections, accidents, setbacks, and of course financial impossibilities. And I count myself incredibly lucky. I am not a victim but a survivor.
In the months following the accident, I gave serious consideration to starting a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to pay for my medical bills. Ultimately I decided against it. That responsibility is mine.
When my insurance company declined to pay for a prosthetic thumb (I wasn’t even going to risk asking for an index finger), I again thought about a GoFundMe campaign. Again, I decided against it. I am resilient enough and innovative enough to make my way in this world with eight fingers or with ten.
To the point (and God bless you if you are still reading): Since the fire, I have tried, and tried, and tried to find steady, rewarding employment. I attempted to return to the small landscaping business that I had started before the accident, but ultimately found it untenable. I am currently working with vocational rehab to find a position where I can use my BA in English or my MS in Addiction Studies - or both. I have high hopes, but no guarantees. And the interim between being accepted into the program and actually securing a job is at the very least a months-long process. Meanwhile, I have zero income. And the medical bills are accruing, the interest rates on my school loans compounding. The worst part is the guilt I feel for leaning on my wonderful, amazing, unbelievable family for help (especially given the limitations of their resources), and the sense of worthlessness I wrestle with without the direction, purpose, and esteem that meaningful employment can provide.
But I have an idea. I am a collector. And I have a talent for researching, finding, and procuring rare, antique, and scarce items at below market cost. I already buy and sell on eBay, but the cost of doing business via that format eliminates much of the potential profit. Since the fire, I have also taught myself to draw, paint, and create assemblage art - using my (non-dominant) right hand. In addition, I have been teaching myself the craft of matting and framing artwork. I also have a wealth of experience in collecting rare, unusual, and first-edition books (I had a library with more than 1,000 volumes before the fire - none survived).
What I am proposing, the endeavor for which I am asking for your help, is to rent a space at a suitable venue (probably an upscale antique mall) at which I would sell fine art (of which I already have some inventory), first edition and antiquarian books, antique and collectible magazines and paper ephemera, my original artwork, classic cameras and typewriters, and other vintage, midcentury modern, and antique items. Most of what I will sell will be from the Art Deco, Art Nouveau, and Midcentury Modern genres.
The money I am trying to raise will pay for startup costs (booth rental, signage, business cards, display tables and cases, picture frames and matting, etc., etc.); to purchase further inventory for resale; to produce lithographs of my original art; and to take a course in how to frame and present artwork professionally. This list is by no means exhaustive - but these are some of the major expenses that I am looking at to get started.
This idea is not something I cooked up overnight. My research shows that the items I have in my inventory already are among the most popular for sale in an antique-mall setting. The notion may strike some as silly, but to me, this project is about a lot more than a job. This is my dream. Nothing grandiose or elaborate, but something honest, and plausible, and meaningful, and humble. This arena fascinates me not for the prospect of making a buck buying and selling dead people’s stuff, but because of the journey in going from discovering an item to acquiring it. I have the chance to protect, preserve, and curate history - and that is what motivates me. I possess the intellect, the ambition, the drive, the ethic, and the determination to succeed. I simply lack the resources. I am about to turn 47, and this is probably the best, and only, shot that I will have at making my dream a reality. I just need a venue and an opportunity.
Thank you, sincerely, for taking the time to read this little proposal. I am more than happy to answer any questions, to provide any information, and to discuss any concerns you may have. And I want to be transparent. I will happily document how your contribution, should you elect to contribute, is spent. Remember that proverb about how you can give a person a fish and feed them for a day, or you can teach a person to fish and feed them for a lifetime? I'm not asking for your fish; I am asking for your help to learn how to fish. Thank you again, and God bless.",1050,8.0,"White, Font"

Her skilled hands unlocked a newfound confidence and sparked a dream within me. As she worked her magic, a weight lifted off my shoulders, and I saw myself in a new light. That moment ignited a passion that only grew stronger with time. I knew I wanted to help others feel as empowered and cared for as I did in that moment.
That spark led me to pursue my esthetician training, which I completed in 2023. I immediately put my new skills into practice and was fortunate enough to continue learning alongside that same exceptional esthetician. Since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering the art of holistic skincare, harnessing the power of plants to heal and nurture my clients. Every session is a pleasure, as I strive to provide the highest standard of care and comfort. The trust my guests place in me is sacred, and it's what aligns me with my values and fuels my passion for this career.
Now, I'm ready to take the next step in my journey, building on the foundation I've established and continuing to grow as a professional. With a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to exceptional care, I'm excited to see where this path takes me.

This wasn’t just a business; it was our dream and our family’s foundation. Every late night, every extra hour, every piece of jewelry we carefully crafted or sourced was a piece of us. Now, we’re left heartbroken, struggling to pick up the pieces, and unsure how to move forward.

My name is Matt Opena, and I'm a full-time freelance cinematographer & DP.
On Saturday, September 13th, my car was broken into in Arts District, LA…
and all of my essential film equipment was stolen.
I lost not only tens of thousands of dollars in gear, but also the tools I rely on to support myself, fulfill current projects, and continue building my career.
For those who know me personally, this isn’t easy to share. As someone who prides himself on being resourceful and self-sufficient, asking for help is and has always been incredibly difficult for me. However, through the warmth and care of my friends and family, I have come to see that asking for help in times like this is more than understandable.
What I Lost:
3x cameras (Nikon z9 fully rigged cinema camera // Nikon z6 B cam rig // Fujifilm x-t4)
1x go pro hero 12 action camera with accessories
All of my lenses (5 lenses total: 2x 24-70mm 2.8 // 70-200mm 2.8 // 23mm 1.4 // 105mm 1.4)
All of my support gear (LiDAR, grip, rig parts, and rigging equipment)
All of my audio recording equipment
All 9 of my external hard drives with work since I started (this one hurts the most)
My new laptop (I just upgraded like 2 months ago )
A pair of AirPod Max
My backpack and Pelican case
There’s more, but that’s the more important stuff. The financial hit is overwhelming, and insurance won’t come close to covering the full extent of the loss, but the biggest hit is something I can’t replace, which is all the past memories and projects I had on those drives. It’s been a really painful and disheartening couple of days, to say the least… But hopefully, with enough donations, I can get right back to making new memories once again.
I have clients counting on me, projects in progress, and a career that depends on having the right tools.
Every dollar raised will go directly toward replacing essential equipment so I can get back to doing what I love — telling visual stories that matter. For those who know me personally, you know I live and breathe this career and all it encompasses. I’ve been blessed to live and experience the many beauties life has to offer through this career and am eagerly trying reset and start again.
Whether you’re able to donate or just share this campaign, every bit helps more than you know. Thank you for taking the time to read this, support me, and lift me back up during this incredibly difficult time. If you want to donate but not through GoFundMe, you can zelle through the QR code I have in the photos. Thank you so much.
Peace, Love, n all the above-

Story:
Curtain Call Performing Arts has been a beloved part of our theatre community for seven years
, serving as a vital resource for aspiring performers of all ages. From voice, dance, and acting classes to piano lessons and studio rentals for rehearsals, David and Danielle Goro have dedicated themselves to nurturing talent and keeping the arts alive in our community.
As many of us know, the entertainment business is tough. For years, Curtain Call has kept afloat by offering these classes and renting their studio, but they've never shied away from dreaming big. Many, including myself, have encouraged them to stage their own productions—a vision that, while exciting, is also costly.
The time has come to help them realize that dream.
Through the generosity of those who can, we hope to support David and Danielle in maintaining and expanding their beautiful endeavor, ensuring Curtain Call continues to inspire, educate, and entertain for many more years to come.
Your donation, no matter the size, will help make this dream possible. Thank you for considering supporting Curtain Call Performing Arts and for helping keep the arts vibrant in our community.

Sadly, they are now facing some very difficult times.
Just this week, they suffered a sudden and unexpected loss of over $1,000 worth of ice cream when their freezer stopped working overnight. This comes on top of heavy personal challenges. Peggy, the owner, is dealing with serious health concerns and ongoing oncology visits, while also caring for her husband, who is 85 and experiencing declining health.
Despite their resilience, the weight of these challenges has been overwhelming. They have even considered taking out a loan on their home just to keep going, which is a huge and stressful step at their age.
We are hoping to raise funds not just to cover the loss of product, but also to help Peggy and her husband hire some help. This would allow Peggy to attend her treatments without worrying about the shop, giving them some much-needed peace of mind.
If you have ever enjoyed a delicious handmade chocolate or a scoop of ice cream from Pieces of Heaven, or if you simply want to support a local family who has given so much to our community, please consider donating. Every contribution, no matter the size, will make a difference.

Hi everyone,
We’re Madison Zajicek and Sarah Brassow, two sisters with one big dream — to build a dance studio that empowers, inspires, and supports every student who walks through our doors. After over 20 years of dancing competitively and teaching the art we love, we are finally making our dream come true — Rebels Academy of Dance is under construction!
But as exciting as this journey is, it's also incredibly expensive. From flooring and mirrors to sound systems and safety equipment — every detail matters when creating a space where dancers can grow and thrive. That’s why we’re reaching out to our community, family, friends, and supporters for help.
Why We’re Doing This:
Dance has shaped who we are. It taught us discipline, confidence, creativity, and resilience. We've poured our hearts into teaching because we know how powerful dance can be — not just for physical development, but for emotional and mental growth, too.
Rebels Academy of Dance isn’t just a studio. It’s a place where young dancers will find strength in themselves, feel safe to express who they are, and build lifelong friendships. We want to create a home for our students — a place filled with energy, love, encouragement, and of course, a little sparkle.
How You Can Help:
Every dollar we raise will go directly toward building our studio:
Specialized dance flooring to protect our dancers’ bodies
Mirrors and barres for technique training
Sound and lighting equipment for performances and recitals
Costumes, props, and materials to make every season unforgettable
And so much more behind the scenes…
Whether you can donate $5 or $500, every bit makes a difference. Even just sharing
our story helps!
We’ve already come so far, and we won’t give up on this dream. With your help, we can build a place that inspires the next generation of dancers to be bold, fearless, and true to themselves — to be rebels in the best way.
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for supporting us and believing in the future of Rebels Academy of Dance.
With love and gratitude,
Madison Zajicek & Sarah Brassow

Dear friends, family, and our amazing community,
HJ Experience was born from a shared vision between two passionate creatives who believe in the power of movement, celebration, and connection. After years of hosting dance classes, wellness sessions, and vibrant events in other people’s spaces, we’re finally creating our own.
We are in the process of securing a location in Houston and officially building HJ Experience—a vibrant, inclusive hub for dance, fitness, events, coffee, natural juices, and small business vendors… all under one roof.
Whether you come to dance, sweat, sip a smoothie, launch your brand, or celebrate your birthday, this space is for YOU.
But dreams need action—and support. That’s where you come in.
We’re launching this campaign to help cover:
Studio buildout (mirrors, lighting, sound, etc)
Equipment for fitness & classes
Operational startup costs.
HJ Experience will be a bilingual space (English & Español)
We want everyone to feel welcome and represented. Classes, signage, events, and energy—fully bilingual and fully inclusive.
Whether you donate, share, or simply send your good vibes—thank you.
You’re not just funding a studio, you’re helping us build a home for joy, movement, and culture.
With love and gratitude,
Héctor & Jair

Hello friends, neighbors, and book lovers near and far, We’re reaching out with hopeful hearts and a bit of vulnerability to ask for your support as we face an unexpected and significant challenge. Our independent bookstore has been part of the Travelers Rest community for 17 wonderful years, and for the past 5, we've been lucky to call Main Street our home. We've weathered many storms over the years, and through it all, our mission has remained the same: to bring people together through the joy of books, ideas, and connection.
The Situation: Our lease is set to end at the end of the year, and is set to double in cost per month. This is not financially viable for us. We've found a new, more affordable space in town, which we’re excited about — but there's a catch: this space is available starting October 1, 2025, which means we’d need to break our lease three months early. Unfortunately, breaking our lease early is not an option, we are still fully responsible for rent, utilities, and maintenance through December 31, even if we vacate. This puts us in a difficult position: we cannot afford to pay rent on two spaces, and we don’t want to lose our chance to stay in this town that is our home.
What We’re Asking: We’re humbly asking for help from our community to raise $15,000 to assist with:
Paying off the remaining lease amount and utilities for the final 3 months of 2025
Covering the costs of moving our inventory, fixtures, and shelving
Making essential improvements to the new space so we can reopen smoothly and keep serving the community
Every dollar brings us closer to continuing the story of this little bookstore in the heart of Travelers Rest. If you’ve ever browsed our shelves, come to an event, shared a book recommendation, or just believe in the magic of independent bookstores, we’d be so grateful for your support. Whether you can give $5 or $500, or just share this with others, it all means the world to us.

I’m 30 years old and based in Phoenix, Arizona. Over the last two years I studied acting in Los Angeles, but along the way I discovered something deeper  a passion for creating. Through acting and YouTube, I realized I was a visionary at heart. Storytelling just made more sense to me, especially because I’ve lived through experiences that fuel my creativity and allow me to express myself authentically. That passion led me to film school, which I completed two months ago, and now I’m ready to bring my very first film to life.
I care deeply about this film because it’s a story I’ve carried in my mind and heart, and now I need to bring it out into the world. I have a strong vision for Lethal Dust, and parts of it are rooted in true experiences that shaped me. Directing gives me a place where I feel completely aligned like I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. For much of my life I often felt misunderstood, but in this realm of storytelling I feel at home. This film is also a way to show people what’s inside my mind, to reveal the depth of my creativity, and to introduce a new side of myself.
I’m raising funds because I want the production value of Lethal Dust to be as high as possible. This story deserves more than a simple backyard film it deserves to look cinematic, polished, and elevated. To fully portray the vision I have in mind, I need the resources to bring every detail to life  from the desert landscapes and costumes to the equipment and post production that will make the film shine on screen.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey and this film. By supporting this campaign, you’re not only helping bring Lethal Dust to life, but also believing in an independent filmmaker. With your help, we can create something truly cinematic, bold, and unforgettable. Thank you so much for being a part of the journey.",1525,10.0,"Chin, Cheek, Eyebrow, Happiness, Forehead"

Dear friends, family, and supporters of P Town,
We’re reaching out with heavy hearts and hopeful spirits. On Friday May 2nd 2025, we were the target of an unannounced inspection by approximately 20 Pennsylvania State Police officers and undercover agents in the middle of a show featuring the legendary Amanda Lepore that resulted in excessive fines and fees. This has placed an overwhelming financial burden on our small, community-driven bar, threatening our ability to keep our doors open.
For over 18 years, P Town has been more than just a bar. It’s been a place where people from all walks of life could gather, celebrate, feel safe, and be seen. We’ve hosted drag shows, benefits, birthdays, pride events, karaoke nights, and countless unforgettable memories. Our mission has always been to serve the community—not just drinks, but love, laughter, and a place to belong.
Now, we need your help.
The fines levied against us are beyond what any small business could endure alone. We believe the resulting penalties were disproportionate, and we’re working to resolve these amounts. But we can’t do it without you.
Your donation will go directly toward:
Paying down the +$60K in state-imposed fines
Assisting with over +$20K in mandatory property renovations. (Some of which have already been completed)
Assisting in legal fees needed to appeal for a reduction in fines.
Keeping P Town open for the community for the foreseeable future.
Every dollar helps. Every share spreads the word. If you’ve ever danced, laughed, or felt welcomed at P Town, we ask you to stand with us now.
Let’s show them that our community is stronger than fear, stronger than injustice, and that we will not be silenced.
With love and gratitude,
The P Town Bar Team

We’re Mobile Shine 903 — your local East Texas mobile detailing crew. For years, we’ve been bringing the shine straight to your driveway: from Deluxe Details to our full Presidential Detail, plus subscriptions that keep your ride spotless week after week.
We’re proud to be a family-owned, local business serving Longview and surrounding areas — keeping cars, trucks, and even fleets looking their best. You may have seen our trailer out around town… until recently.
The Setback
This past week, our trailer — the backbone of our operation — suffered major wheel and axle damage.
The hub and brake assembly completely broke down, causing structural damage to our trailer and leaving the wheel unusable. Currently, the trailer is unsafe to move.
See the photos of the damage below — this is what we’re dealing with.
Without a working trailer, we can’t transport our tanks, supplies, or detailing equipment to customers. It puts a full stop on our ability to detail for our customers around East Texas.
Why We’re Asking for Help
We’ve already shouldered a lot of unexpected costs out of pocket these past few weeks, but
this one is too big.
The cost of replacing the trailer is around $13,000. We are also looking into every solution to get our rig back up and going.
Your support will:
Cover a new trailer purchase so we can get back to serving clients
Make sure we’re safe and reliable on the road
Keep Mobile Shine 903 alive as a local, family-owned business
Our Promise
We’ll continue doing what we love: delivering high-quality, mobile detailing with care and hustle. Your donation isn’t just helping us fix a trailer — it’s keeping a small business alive and rolling.
How You Can Help
Donate – Any amount, even $10, makes a difference.
Share – Post this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, or text it to a friend.
Book Ahead – Once we’re rolling again, we’ll offer campaign supporters early scheduling and special perks.

From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for reading and supporting us. With your help, we’ll get back on the road and keep bringing the shine across East Texas.

Cooking has been my passion for over 20 years. It’s more than just food to me — it’s love, creativity, and soul on a plate.
For years, I’ve been selling plates out of the trunk of my car, sharing meals with my community and watching people light up with joy after tasting my cooking. Every dish I make comes from the heart, seasoned with love and created with soul in mind.
Now, I’m ready to take the next step. My dream is to open a food truck — a place where I can finally showcase my talent, share my unique and creative dishes with more people, and continue spreading love through food. This food truck would allow me to grow, serve more customers, and finally build something sustainable after years of grinding and hustling.
I’m asking for your help to make this dream a reality. Your support will go toward:
•	Purchasing a reliable food truck
•	Equipping it with the tools and appliances needed
•	Covering licenses and startup costs
No donation is too small — every single blessing gets me closer to turning this dream into a reality. If you can’t donate, sharing this page means the world to me too.

Hello friends, I’m so excited to finally share something that’s been steeping in my heart for a long time.
This autumn, I’m launching , a small queer-owned tea business based in Durham, NC. equaliTEA will be a locally run stand offering hot and cold tea by the cup and high-quality loose-leaf teas to take home. With time (and a little help), I hope to grow into online sales (one of my goals is a tea subscription box for Durham)  and fun, community-driven merchandise that will feature local artists.
At its core, equaliTEA is about offering delicious high quality tea for an affordable price. Durham has lacked a dedicated tea shop for a long time, and I want to change that and give Durham a place for tea lovers to gather and enjoy. I truly love tea from the bottom of my heart, and I want nothing more than to share this love with the people of Durham.
Starting a small business from the ground up is both exciting and a little daunting, but I’ve been planning carefully to keep my startup costs low and sustainable. With your support, I can bring equaliTEA to life and start serving the community I love. Don't worry, I made sure the costs weren't too steep!
Where Your Support Goes
I’m keeping initial costs under $3,000, and your contributions will help cover:
Electric kettles
Tables and display setup
Sales system (like a Square reader and tablet)
Permits and licensing fees
Branding (logo, signs, printed materials)
Initial tea inventory
Portable power supply
cups, napkins, infusers, and other supplies
Every dollar raised will go directly into building a strong foundation for equaliTEA, one cup, one customer, one connection at a time.
Let’s Make Something Special
This business means so much to me , not just as a personal dream, but as a way to give something back to the community that has always inspired me. With your help, I can turn equaliTEA from an idea into a cozy little reality, and I’d be so honored to have you along for the journey.

During COVID, many of you know we were forced to close for almost two years.
Many of you offered us some monetary help at that time. Humbly we said, thank you and we are ok for now, but if and when we need help, we will reach out. Well, here we are. Thankfully, we made it through that crazy time. Lost my parents to it though. Then last year, we were down for months dealing with water well issues caused by all the rain and flooding. At that time, Spring Creek eroded away the berm that kept all that water at bay and found a new path to travel right across this property.
This year, with all the rain and standing water, we had to close again for two and a half months. Even after all this downtime, and God willing, we are still here. And we know those bills still come every month.
I know we are all feeling the crunch of the cost of foods and supplies. Today, we are at a pivotal moment. Do we just let the Greendoor continue to go underwater like this, causing further damage, or do we save this iconic steakhouse?

When Hurricane Helene hit Asheville, Matty had everything prepped to launch his pizza business—a reliable sourdough starter, fresh veggies, a trusty oven, but with Asheville shut down, nowhere to sell his pies.
So he did what any heart-led chef would do:
He fired up the ovens anyway and started slingin’ pies for free to support his community in West Asheville. Out of that moment, the first community pizza nights were born—gatherings where a free hot meal, a little laughter and a place to gather when there was no power or water for weeks on end.
People came for a meal, and kept coming back for the the feeling of community. Most had no idea the pizza was vegan. No menu. No marketing. Just really good pizza, shared from the heart.
It was that community that helped birth Pizza Finta into existence.
Since then, what started as a backyard vibe turned into a cult-favorite food experience—powered by a tiny retrofitted Japanese truck and an even bigger mission: Build community, support local farmers, and serve up the best pizza in Asheville.
But now,
the future of Pizza Finta is at a turning point.

My name is Amanda Cuney Lopez. I was born and raised in New Paltz, and am now raising my two girls here! As a local business owner and the founder of Soul Tribe, a group fitness studio that has already brought so many people in our community together, I’ve seen firsthand the power of creating spaces where people can connect and support one another.
I’m now working on my next project: My Little Village—an indoor play space designed especially for preschool-aged children and their caregivers. More than just a play space, My Little Village is about community building. It’s a place where kids can play safely indoors, and where parents and caregivers can connect, share, and feel less alone in the journey of raising children.
Another exciting element of My Little Village is creating flexible jobs for stay at home parents. Short shifts that allow parents to bring their children with them, giving them the opportunity to have their child play for free and bring in some extra cash to help their families.
Think play time, workshops, birthday parties, art events, all geared toward families and community building.
I’m raising funds to help bring this vision to life—to create a welcoming, safe, and fun environment that gives families in New Paltz and beyond a place to gather, grow, and build lasting connections.

We've thought long and hard about how to recover from this devastating event. One of the major considerations is that we need to move to a new location to avoid repeat flooding events. We are committed to staying in Chapel Hill because of the amazing community we've been a part of here. A new location will need to be fitted for the store and so there is quite a bit for us to do. We're excited and hopeful about bringing Yarns etc back, so we need your help!

My name is Sumego Thompson, and I’m the proud owner of
Nevaeh Studio Salon/Barbershop and Nevaeh Studios Cosmetology & Barber Institute
, located on Main Street in Frisco, Texas.
For over 10 years, I’ve poured my heart into serving this community, helping people look and feel their best while giving back through fundraisers, free back-to-school haircuts, school supplies, and much more. In December 2024, I followed my dream and opened a beauty school to empower the next generation of barbers and cosmetologists.
But now, everything I’ve built is at risk. Ongoing construction on Main Street in Frisco, Texas, has devastated my business:
No sidewalk access in front of the salon
Limited parking shared with multiple businesses
Confusing detours that have driven away foot traffic
No budget left for advertising due to lost revenue
Business has slowed to a near standstill. I’m doing everything I can to keep going, but I’ve fallen behind on rent and bills and am at serious risk of losing both the salon and the school.
I’m asking for your help to keep Nevaeh Studios alive. Your donation will go toward:
Rent and utilities
Daily operational expenses
Support for students and staff
A future marketing push once we stabilize
Every dollar truly makes a difference. If you can’t give, please share this campaign so more people can help. Frisco is growing quickly, but small businesses like mine should have the chance to grow with it- not disappear because of construction setbacks.
With heartfelt gratitude,
Sumego Thompson

Paws & Sip.
I’ve dreamed of opening a space where community, comfort, and cats come together.
Paws and Sip is more than just a café — it’s a cozy, welcoming environment where people can unwind with fresh pastries, lovingly made drinks, and the calming presence of adoptable cats.
I'm opening
Bakersfield’s first cat café
— a place that blends delicious, made-from-scratch cinnamon rolls and lattes with a relaxing, thoughtfully designed cat lounge where cats can play, nap, and (hopefully!) find their forever homes.
Why Paws & Sip is asking for Help
Starting a brick-and-mortar business is expensive, especially one that also serves as a safe haven for animals. I’ve already filed all my paperwork, and am working through the final stages of getting a small business loan. But, sometimes even with a solid plan, you just need a little boost.
I’m raising funds to help cover:
Renovations (including a custom-built cat lounge and air filtration)
Café equipment
Cat furniture, toys, and supplies
Starting inventory and ingredients
Startup costs until we’re self-sustaining
Your support will go directly toward making this dream possible — helping me create a one-of-a-kind place in Bakersfield where cats, coffee, and community come together.
What makes Paws & Sip Special?
Paws & Sip provides a safe, loving environment where homeless cats receive daily care, comfortable housing, and medical attention — all while helping them find their forever families.
All pastries are baked fresh, in-house — no shortcuts, just real ingredients and daily love.
A separate, thoughtfully designed cat lounge lets visitors relax and bond with adoptable cats in a clean, calm space.
Affordable merchandise & artist vending machines will spotlight local creators!
Memberships and events will keep the café engaging and accessible year-round.
Community-focused projects like free pet food for low-income households, coupons for volunteers from collaborating organizations, a community garden, and much, much more!
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for supporting me and this
dream. I can’t wait to serve you a warm cinnamon roll, introduce you to an adorable cat, and watch this community grow.

5 Points Art Gallery + Studios
has been more than just a building in Milwaukee’s Harambee neighborhood. It is
a home, a platform, and a lifeline
for artists locally and globally. We’ve provided affordable housing for artists, hosted exhibitions that sparked dialogue, offered residencies that launched careers, and welcomed the community into an inclusive cultural hub.
Now, this legacy is under threat.
On
December 1, 2025
, a
$260,000 balloon payment
is due. Without it, 5 Points will face foreclosure, and Milwaukee risks losing one of its last independent spaces dedicated to accessible, community-driven art.
This isn’t just about saving a building, it’s about
preserving culture, creativity, and a sanctuary where artists and neighbors can thrive together.
Why 5 Points Matters:
Affordable Artist Housing:
Providing safe, sustainable spaces for creatives in a city where affordability is rare.
Groundbreaking Exhibitions:
Showcasing BIPOC, emerging, and international artists.
Residencies + Workshops:
Equipping artists with tools to grow, while engaging youth and community members.
Community Advocacy:
Standing as a bulwark against displacement and cultural erasure.
How Funds Will Be Used:
$260,000 Balloon Payment:
To secure ownership of the gallery and prevent foreclosure.
Sustainability Investments:
Ensuring future programming, exhibitions, and housing remain intact.
How You Can Help:

Any amount helps. $20, $50, $100, $1,000... every gift pushes us closer.

Hi! We’re Dan Perry and Michael Serapiglia. We’re partners in life, proud gay men, and passionate world travelers. We’re raising money to
purchase Toto Tours
, a pioneering LGBTQ+ travel company that has connected our community through exploration, joy, and adventure since 1990.
With your help, we’ll carry this beloved company into its next era, preserving its legacy while reimagining its future for a new generation of queer travelers.
Why Toto Tours Matters
Toto Tours has been a trusted name in LGBTQ+ travel for over 30 years. Founded by Dan Ware in 1990, it’s the longest-running gay tour company in continuous operation under one owner (a rare and inspiring example of queer business longevity).
More than just vacations, Toto Tours creates community. It offers LGBTQ+ people the chance to safely experience the world while being fully themselves, free of judgment, full of laughter, and surrounded by chosen family. As our rights and safety vary from country to country, that kind of space is more important than ever.
As Dan Ware prepares for retirement, he’s entrusted us with the opportunity to carry this vision forward. We’re honored - and excited - to take the reins.
Why This Is Personal
I’m Dan Perry, a performer, producer, and gay man with a deep love for the arts, community, and cultural exchange. I’ve spent most of my life on stage or behind the scenes, creating meaningful experiences for others. I’ve also been lucky enough to travel the world, and those experiences have changed me, opening my heart, challenging my thinking, and strengthening my pride in who I am.
Michael Serapiglia, my partner in this journey, brings his own passion for travel, people, and purpose. Together, we believe that travel should do more than entertain. It should connect, affirm, inspire, and transform.
That’s why we’re committed to continuing what Toto Tours does best and expanding it with fresh energy, broader destinations, and new kinds of experiences that reflect today’s beautifully diverse LGBTQ+ community.
What Your Support Will Do
Your donations will help us:
Purchase Toto Tours and keep this LGBTQ+ legacy alive
Cover key transition costs like legal fees, business planning, and relaunch expenses
Modernize the brand and website
Expand tour offerings to include music, theater, wellness, and cultural themes
Build partnerships with LGBTQ+ creatives, nonprofits, and local guides
Launch a scholarship program for travelers with limited means in the future
Every dollar helps. Whether you give $5, $500, or $5,000, you’re investing in something meaningful: LGBTQ+ joy, safety, connection, and freedom to explore the world.
Let’s make sure Toto Tours continues to thrive, not just for those of us who love to travel, but for those still discovering who they are and where they belong.

Now a certified Braille transcriber, Ashley is passionate about giving back to the blind community by providing Braille transcription and tutoring services to those who need them most. Her business, VIP Braille Services, serves both children and adults, offering lessons virtually and in person, and she has worked with school districts and businesses such as an elevator company in New York. Testimonials from satisfied clients highlight the impact of her work and her commitment to quality and accessibility.
Currently, Ashley faces significant challenges without access to a personal Braille embosser. She must manually type out Braille materials on a Perkins Braille writer, which is time-consuming and limits her ability to produce high-quality materials quickly. This process creates delays for her students and clients, and makes it difficult to meet the needs of businesses and organizations that require professional Braille documents. With a Braille Buddy Embosser, Ashley would be able to create high-quality Braille materials, including graphics, much more efficiently. This would allow her to reduce wait times for tutoring lessons, serve more clients, and expand her reach across the country.
Ashley’s goal is to use the embosser to further Braille literacy, provide faster and more accurate services, and help more people access the resources they need. By supporting her fundraiser, donors will help Ashley continue her mission to empower the blind community and make Braille accessible to all who need it.",545,7.0,

I have been traveling to northern Arizona over the past few years to teach yoga at a resort during the summer months, when the heat in Tucson is unbearable. When I was there in August of this year, one woman came up to me after class and informed me that their beloved yoga studio would be closing, due to the current owner retiring at the young age of 82! The studio was going up for sale, and the offer presented itself...would I be willing and able to take it over?
At first, I thought ""heck no!"", but the woman from class said that she would bring more students with her the next time I was teaching there. So, 2 weeks later, I found myself teaching to 18 people in the pine forests of northern Arizona. There were some current teachers at the studio and a few loyal students who came to check out my teaching style and meet with me. After class, I listened to their individual stories about how much the studio meant to them.
So, I decided to go look at the space. It's lovely. Fully built out with hard-wood floors, a bathroom, and a separate room to see private clients or teach small group classes. It's...perfect. If I could take over the rent, the current local teachers will be able to continue offering their unique and well-attended classes. I would also have a place to teach and play on my monthly visits back to the area. Maybe even some of my Tucson students would join me for a weekend getaway or mini-retreat. This would also serve as a welcoming space for visiting teachers from all over the world.
Launching a wellness studio is a dream, but it takes resources to bring it to life. Our goal is $20,000, which will go directly toward:
Rent and insurance for one year – providing stability and a home base
Props & equipment – mats, bolsters, blankets, singing bowls, and sound instruments
Utilities – keeping the space warm, welcoming, and functional
Community accessibility – ensuring everyone has access to the tools they need to feel supported on their wellness journey

After five years of serving the Dallas–Fort Worth area as a mobile dessert business, my team of Puffatiers and I are ready to take the next step: opening our very first pop-up shop in Irving, Texas. This is a 3-month pop-up in a retail space, designed to test if we’re ready for something more long term. Our soft opening will be October 10th and 11th, with the official grand opening and ribbon cutting on November 1st.
Our journey began with a single trailer and a dream to create one-of-a-kind ice cream experiences. We’re known for our signature ice cream puffs—a warm, sweet Korean-style bun filled with your choice of ice cream and toppings. Over the years, we’ve become a beloved part of the community, bringing joy and creativity to every event we attend.
This pop-up shop is more than just a new location; it’s a chance to build a gathering place where families, friends, and neighbors can come together. We want to revitalize Irving with a space full of excitement, connection, and, of course, delicious desserts. The funds from this fundraiser will help us cover essential costs like cosmetic repairs, new equipment, staff, and the fresh ingredients that make our puffs so special. Every dollar will go directly toward creating a welcoming environment and ensuring we can serve our community at our very best.
Opening this shop is a dream built on resilience, hard work, and the support of people who believe in what we do. With your help, we can make this pop-up a reality and take the first step toward a permanent home for ZZ’s Ice Cream Puffs. Thank you for being part of our story and helping us bring more joy to Irving.",1295,24.0,"Dessert, Logo, Food, Advertising, Fast food"

As some of you may know, CrossFit Body Evolution is expanding. This is a huge new endeavor that Lindsay is taking on full steam head all by herself with her husband, Tyler.
There have been a lot of unexpected financial burdens that have come to play during this process making it a little bit stressful for Lindsay.
She’s had some unexpected inspections that have needed to happen as well as having to hire an architect to handle a portion of the process so that she is able to start operating.
Well, all this is going on, she has also bought an entire gym of brand new equipment from the ground up. This is definitely not a cheap expense as well!
We all love Lindsay and know the heart  and passion that she has for this community.
She has no idea that we are doing this, but I would love to raise some funds to help her with this next step forward and to give her a little bit of a break throughout this process.
Anything helps, and only donate what you can! And I know in the end, Lindsey will be so appreciative of whatever help she can get!

From the beginning, we’ve committed to using only fully organic ingredients, with no shortcuts, no artificial flavors — just nostalgic, thoughtfully crafted treats made with care and intention.
Our mission has always been about more than just cookies. We want every bite to feel like a warm memory: cozy, joyful, and deeply personal. The kind of sugar cookie that doesn’t just taste amazing (though it absolutely does) — it reminds you that you’re home, you’re celebrated, you’re connected.
I started baking these cookies with my mom. After she passed, those memories in the kitchen became one of the greatest gifts she left me. That’s the heart behind Lyssie Lou’s — to help others create their own lasting moments, just like I did.
Now, after pausing to refine our vision and rebuild intentionally,
we’re preparing to relaunch this December — and we’d love your help bringing it to life.
Our Goal
We’re looking for 65 donors to each contribute $100 to help fund our comeback.
In return? You’ll receive an exclusive invite to the Lyssie Lou’s Tasting Party — a cozy, community-driven event where you’ll:
Be the first to try our brand-new seasonal frosting flavors
Enjoy free coffee, savory snacks, and a beautifully curated tasting experience
Connect with other supporters who care about small-batch, organic, woman-owned businesses
If you donate $400 or more, you will be invited to all four of our tasting events, one for each season!
It’s our way of saying thank you — and bringing you into the heart of what we’re building.
Can’t give $100 or $400? We totally understand — every bit helps.
As a thank-you, any donation amount will receive 10% off all your December cookie orders. It’s our small way of saying we appreciate your support, no matter the size.
Where Your Donation Goes
Your support helps us:
Finalize new monthly flavor recipes
Source premium, organic ingredients for testing flavors
Design and launch sustainable packaging
Build a pared-down, elevated website to match our refined brand
Host our first tasting event with our new flavors
Kick off with a beautiful December drop
Find our future home where we make our cookies
You’re not just funding cookies. You’re helping us lay the foundation for a thoughtful, long-lasting, year-round business that celebrates flavor, artistry, and community.
Why It Matters
Our goal has always been to be one of the most intentional. Every cookie we make is a reflection of what we value most:
Only organic ingredients — no shortcuts, ever
Consistent, hand-crafted quality you can taste in every bite
Small-batch joy, made with care and delivered with love
A business model rooted in connection
Paying and treating the people we work with well
Whether you’ve been with us since day one or just found your way to our cookies, this relaunch is our love letter to you — to our customers, our community, and to the belief that doing things differently is always worth it.",4000,66.0,Blue

The Question that Changed Everything
When was the last time you spoke to someone who LIVES where you're going before you arrived?
Tour guides need a secondary income, Travelers need human connection. We created a platform that connects tour guides directly with travelers - giving guides steady income while bringing authentic local experiences back to travel.
Travelers spend 60+ hours across 50+ websites yet still book the wrong experiences.
Travel agencies push packages.
Influencers sell sponsorships.
Google AI give you generic and Information Overload.
But the best person to plan your trip is a local professional—a tour guide who actually lives there. You don't have to plan alone, like a conquistador on your side of the world. Channel a local before making all of your travel decisions.

Our Story: From Chance Encounter to Global Platform
Chicago, 2001.
A young Brazilian immigrant tours Rosana around the city. Twenty-three years later, that sparked a global movement.
Rosana
, a 34-year travel industry veteran and former Director at JTB Group, led a recovery project that achieved outstanding results and also led the team that won one of the Top 10 corporate travel accounts in Brazil. She saw the missing link: travelers crave authentic human connection and truly custom experiences.
Leticia
, who came to America at 9 as an immigrant, became a licensed architect, military spouse, and traveler at heart. She joined Rosana in designing the solution, often late into the night, even while pregnant - because she believed this could change everything.
Together, they turned personal experiences into a platform ready to revolutionize how the world travels.
Enter Leticia—came to America at 9 as an immigrant, became a licensed architect, military spouse, traveler at heart who loves solving complex problems.
Rosana identified the gap. Leticia helped design the solution.
Picture this: Rosana pinpointing exactly what travelers needed. Leticia and Rosana designing the platform late into the night, pregnant growing belly and all, because they knew this could change everything.

After a few quiet years, I decided to bring back a charity event through my Instagram. This is my way of putting some good into the world during such a chaotic time. This October, I’m partnering with the American Cancer Society for their 100-Miles Challenge although I’m flipping it a bit:
every $5 donated equals 1 mile I’ll run, up to 100 miles.
(I’ll keep donations open through the first week of October since I’m starting late.)
For me, this cause is personal. My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2019, and that moment was something that truthfully rocked my world. She’s doing much better now, but we all know someone who’s fought—or lost—someone to cancer. With running becoming my thing this past year, so I’m turning miles into support.
Please consider donating or sharing this GoFundMe to help hit our donation goal.
Thanks everyone,
Tyler Monell",700,20.0,

I’m Jess Erb. I am a fat fitness professional with over 4000 hours of wellness training. I am a yoga teacher and educator, and a Pilates instructor. And— a mom. I want to open a private/ semi-private Pilates studio in my home that focuses on bringing classic/ classic inspired sessions to ALL bodies. No mirrors, no narrow raised mats, no 22” chair seats… my dream is that anyone can use anything they see when they walk in and that I have exactly what I need to teach classes sequenced for accessibility.
Raising money to supplement the cost of Pilates equipment will help me price control my services and get started soon. First, to price control, I am going to consider the cost of my training (about $10k when all is said and done) as a loss and working from my home will eliminate rent. Second, I could do this in a couple more years, readjusting my timeline after a very difficult pregnancy and first year as a mom (IYKYK)… but I believe I have something to offer imminently. There’s a place for this work.

I know I can do this, but I need your help! Any help big or small will be blessing. I will accept prayers and positive vibes sent my way too.
To reopen this center, I need funds to:
* Secure the building
* Clean, update, and renovate the inside of the building
* Landscaping and updating the outdoor playground
* Hire and train staff
* Meet updated licensing and safety requirements
* Purchase essential supplies and learning materials
* Create a new logo for branding, marketing, and social media pages
Once I get the building and start the cleaning and renovating process, I will adjust the amount to help with continuing costs until everything is complete and the center has officially opened.
The center will have a new name and while I have one in mind, I am open to other suggestions!
I will also share updates through this page as well as my social media pages, so you can see the progress once we get this going!",880,,"Smile, Chin, Cheek, Happiness, Eyebrow"

Currently he is going through a legal dispute with his business partners who are trying to push him out of a company that he helped create while spending countless hours, labor, giving up personal time, sleep, etc to get it to the point where it is today.
His goal was to create a place were kids and young adults could come and train and share in the love of the sport of soccer. At the same time to teach them life lessons not only on the field but off the field. Along with doing things to help the local communities was going to be another goal of his that has been stopped short during this legal battle.
During the short time that his business has been open the last 2 1/2 years he has not only helped develop kids and young adults into better soccer players on the field and off the field. He has also been there for those who were struggling mentally by simply just listening and helping them and their families during some difficult times.
Currently he is struggling to help cover the bills of the business to keep the doors open and legal costs to keep up the fight.

For the past few years, I’ve been grinding in shared kitchens and pop-ups all over the DFW area, serving dishes like our Fried Chicken Sandwiches, Rasta Pasta, and Chopped BBQ Rib Sandwich — all made with love, culture, and heat.
Now, it’s time for the next step: our own home base in Dallas.

•	Cook more consistently and expand the menu
•	Cut wait times for online orders
•	Offer pickup, catering, and private dining more often
•	Keep creating new vegan food that hits like comfort food should

•	First month’s location deposit
•	Kitchen equipment and setup
•	City of Dallas permits and fees
•	Basic renovations to get the space ready
If you’ve ever pulled up for a plate, shared a post, or told somebody “you gotta try Vegan Heat,” — this next move is for us.

My name is Kayla, and I am the owner of Organizing With Kayla. I’m a professional organizer, cleaner, and interior designer with a passion for helping people transform their homes into supportive, peaceful, and functional spaces. Over the years, I’ve worked with many individuals and families, including those who are neurodivergent, living with chronic pain, or navigating mental health challenges. My goal is always to create spaces that ease stress, promote independence, and bring a sense of calm.
Why I’m Raising Funds
I believe that everyone deserves to live in a home that supports their well-being—no matter their financial situation. Unfortunately, many low-income individuals and families cannot afford professional organizing and design services, even though these services can make a life-changing difference.
This fundraiser will help bridge that gap. All donations will go directly toward providing free or reduced-cost organizing, cleaning, and design services for low-income clients in my community as well as out of state individuals. The funds will cover essential supplies, travel expenses, and the time and care it takes to transform each home into a safe and welcoming space.
The Impact
Your support does more than organize a home—it restores dignity, reduces daily stress, and helps people feel proud of where they live. With your help, I can make sure that financial hardship never stands in the way of someone having a home that truly supports their mental health, physical needs, and quality of life.

We started with a dream and our own hard-earned money, funding everything out of our pockets because we believed in the vision. No investors. No grants. No outside funding. Just faith, determination, and the willingness to work.
Along the way, we’ve faced the real challenges of being small business owners: the rising costs of keeping our doors open, the long nights after our full-time jobs, and the constant push to grow while making sure our employees have opportunities too.
But we never gave up. We’ve hired talented team members who now rely on us for income. We’ve built a community of clients who trust us with their self-care. And we know this is only the beginning of what The Serene Scene can become.
Now, we’re at a turning point. We have the passion, we have the talent, and we have the foundation—but what we’re missing is the guidance and marketing power to push us forward. That’s why
we’re raising $4,500 to invest in:
• Mentorship ($2,500 for 8 weeks + $1,500 for a 2-day in-person training) to give us the strategies and structure to make this business sustainable long-term.
• Marketing ($500 for Google Ads) to help new clients find us and keep revenue flowing.
This isn’t just about keeping a spa open—it’s about building something that lasts. A place where beauty professionals can thrive, where clients can recharge, and where the community can feel cared for.
We’re asking for your support—whether it’s $1, $10, or even just sharing this fundraiser.
Every single contribution helps us get one step closer to stability, growth, and impact.

My name is Ava, and I’m the heart behind Kava Queen—a space where people come together to relax, connect, and experience the grounding traditions of kava. We started small, sharing a shop, learning as we went, and pouring our love into every cup. Now, it’s time for the next chapter: a standalone kava bar at the silos!
This move means:
✨ A space that’s just ours for gatherings, music, and cultural events
✨ Extended hours so you can see us in the daytime
✨ A full menu of traditional kava, creative kava drinks, and other drink options!!!
✨ A community hub that honors Pacific Island traditions while welcoming everyone
Opening this new space takes resources—furnishings, permits, supplies, and a build-out that matches the dream in my heart. As a small, independent business owner, I can’t do it alone. As fun and amazing my first year at the silos has been, it has also taken a tax on my mental & physical health. The bar never really got to a place where it was thriving. I have seven carpool tunnel in both of my hands and am just absolutely exhausted. I cannot wait to open during the day time as I feel it will life changing for my business. I love you all so much and am so grateful.
Your donation will help us create a warm, welcoming kava bar that celebrates culture, connection, and community.",235,7.0,"Wood, Wood stain, Hardwood, Fence, Handrail"

My name is Denisia Ealy, and I’m a proud recent graduate of the University of North Texas where I earned my degree in Media Arts with a minor in Marketing. During my time at UNT, I had the honor of serving as Secretary of the Exquisite Eta Alpha Chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc. and as Director of Marketing for the Professional Women’s Council (2024–2025).

It resulted in a concussion and several bruises on his shoulder and ribs. Domenico now suffers from post-concussion syndrome, severe eye pain, headaches, dizziness, among other symptoms. Due to this incident, Domenico was forced to close the business for a week, leading to a significant loss of his supplies and earnings. He reopened under restricted duties, requiring his current employee to work more hours, which comes at an additional cost. Many have suggested creating a GoFundMe to help him recover his losses. He listened.
Over the years, Domenico has become an indispensable part of the community. His love of people and his desire to delight them with great food have been the foundation of Caffe Paradiso, also referred to as a second home by many of his customers. It all started during the pandemic, when he was looking for a location to open his new restaurant, that is when fell for that “paradise” view. Hence, Caffe Paradiso. He ran larger restaurants in different places around East Bay, but never something that intimate. It was perfect for him. He made it a great environment for interpersonal relationships to flourish. Many customers became his close friends. Yet, in these difficult times, he needs some support.

Friends, if you've followed our 10-year journey from scrappy, born-in-a-barn startup, you'll know we've faced obstacles from the dreadful wind & rain variety (ice storms) to neighbors dragging us into court and perhaps worst of all, the beloved brewhouse that gave up the ghost in 2024, causing an 8-month production shutdown.
The recent closure of Benjamin Rd. has been one of the hardest. Traffic to the brewery has dropped off. Benjamin is closed forever. The alternate route will wind through condos at Crestview. Or, the 3 mile detour we are all using now.
So many good breweries are closing, but we do not intend to go down the same path.
We launched this brewery 10 years ago with heart pounding support from friends, family, and passionate beer fans before we even really started construction, and it's time for us to do it again.
IN OUR NEW DOWNTOWN NEWBERG LOCATION. Yep. A 2nd spot!
THE PLANS
It's go time. This fall we plan to open a 2nd location in downtown Newberg where we can present not only our award-winning beers but also delicious food, cocktails (eventually), wines, ciders, NA, plus (drumroll, please), really good, amplified LIVE MUSIC.
None of those things beyond beer tasting are currently allowed at the farm on a regular basis. But with the continued success of Thursday bluegrass nights and the Newgrass Festival, which is scheduled to return in mid-March 2026, the timing feels right.
It is one of the very coolest, and as-yet-unknown spaces in town, a refurbished 1940s auto shop on Meridian, just around the corner from Rosmarino, the food card pod, and other East end favorites. It's also owned by the good folks behind The 1888, vintage apartments in Newberg's oldest building (which is attached to the one I'm describing), home of the Newberg Graphic and the first bank in town (and future home of an area chef's fine dining establishment - details when can share!). As history buffs, we practically fell in love before we even saw the place. Then we walked in.... and WOW. Think weathered wood rafters, faded paint, glinting sunlight, antique green lamp shades like we have already. It's a natural extension of what we love about the barn where all this started a decade and 300+ recipes ago.
If things continue on track, we will be grand-opening this addition to Newberg
this November
. At that point, the farm's tasting area will be buttoned up this and every winter (at least until Spring when Newgrass season rolls back around), available for private rentals and occasional one-offs.
WE CAN'T WAIT! With our relationships in the music industry (including the curators of Pickathon), we can bring Newberg and the valley a venue that will reverberate with great music all year round. And yes, we'll have the full gamut of W&P beers, plus guest beers, cans, bottles, and merch to go.
THE COST & HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT
It's substantial, and coming off the last two years we've faced, no small task. We have some funding but need more. Donations go directly to me on behalf of the brewery.
In addition to permitting and moving costs for a ton of gear, we'll install custom cold storage, optimal draft equipment, bar amenities, stage/sound/lighting gear, paint, artworks, furniture, myriad functional items for the spot itself, making it feel like a true extension of W&P from day one. (All beermaking stays on the farm by the way).
The initial goal is $16,000, which could help the walk in part especially, but we will need to go well beyond that investment wise to make it all work the way it should.
STRETCH GOAL
Because the Benjamin road closure is never going away, we also do need to fix that ASAP for the sake of the business now and in the future. It does not seem the city, county, or developers responsible for the closure feel like pitching in. But with your help, we can plan to work with local excavators to build 550' of gravel road from 99W to the barn on the Eastern perimeter of the property, which is fairly difficult-to-farm, sloped orchard that would better serve as a driveway. (While the city/county will open a paved route through the new ""Crestview Crossing"" neighborhood that comes closer, it's a bit convoluted.) Estimated costs are coming together, but it won't be a cent under $25K, maybe double that. This is heavy excavation work. But we know how to get it done. This is secondary to getting the new location going.

As a speech-language pathologist, I’ve learned firsthand, how important it is to slow down, lean in,  and listen.  The more I listen and respond this way, the more the children - and I - grow in connection, confidence, and communication.
Too often, the responsibility for change falls unfairly on autistic people and others who communicate in ways that may not be typical.  As Damian Milton’s Double Empathy Problem reminds us, communication is a two-way street.  Therapists, parents, and society all share responsibility for adapting so that everyone can be understood.  But right now, even with our best efforts, it’s often difficult and time-consuming for families and professionals to truly understand the unique ways children communicate.
That’s why I’m developing a mobile app designed to help caregivers and speech therapists interpret children’s natural communication patterns and adapt their own styles to support growth.  This project is rooted in a neurodiversity-affirming mindset and celebrates children’s authentic voices while fostering collaboration between parents and professionals.
To bring this vision to life, I need to raise $10,000 for the research and development phase.  This is the critical first step before applying for a larger grant from the National Institutes of Health.
Please consider donating and sharing this campaign. Every dollar truly makes a difference and can support building a future where communication is shared, equitable, and inclusive, and every child’s voice is heard and celebrated.

Our bakery has always been about more than just sweets—it’s about community, joy, and bringing people together through delicious cupcakes and cookies.
Recently, our brand-new Blodgett oven suddenly stopped heating, leaving us unable to bake the treats our customers know and love. Unfortunately, the cost to replace it is more than we can afford at this time, and without it, our little bakery can’t run the way it should.
We’re asking for help to raise $13,000 so we can purchase a new oven and get back to doing what we love—baking fresh, delicious goodies for our neighborhood. Any amount, big or small, would mean the world to us and help us keep our doors open and our ovens warm.
Thank you so much for supporting small businesses like ours and for helping us continue spreading sweetness in Chicago.",2596,43.0,"Eyewear, Glasses, Vision Care, Happiness, Smile"

Since 2017, we’ve taught hundreds of students — from infants to grandparents, including children with disabilities and autism — how to survive, thrive, and fall in love with the water. In 2022, we found a home at a facility in Katy, TX, where our mission of drowning prevention and water confidence continued to grow. Families from every background joined us to learn, and our students became living proof that with patience, guidance, and practice, everyone can learn to swim.
This spring, our journey took an unexpected turn. The facility we’d been using closed suddenly, leaving us without a pool almost overnight. As we worked to find a solution, life delivered even more challenges: I was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery, Coach Rudy became seriously ill, and my wife and I faced the heartbreak of a miscarriage. Despite these hardships, we refused to stop. By God’s grace, we kept teaching this summer using our apartment pool and an outdoor community pool. Weather delays and limited space made it tough, but thanks to the families who stood by us, we built momentum that we are determined to carry forward into our own facility.
Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death in children, yet it is 100% preventable with the right education. We believe swimming isn’t just a sport — it’s a life skill every person deserves. Our classes serve babies, toddlers, parents, competitive swimmers, and children with disabilities through adaptive programs. With your help, we can secure a permanent indoor pool, purchase training tools and adaptive equipment, offer scholarships, and expand our special needs programs. Every donation moves us closer to building a safe, inclusive swim school where everyone is welcomed and supported. Please donate, share, and help us make a Big Splash again. Together, we can keep our community safe, strong, and swimming.",3427,38.0,"Swimming pool, Recreation, Leisure, Resort, Fun"

All proceeds support our free weekly clinics for people with Parkinson’s, our expansion to new locations, and a contribution to the Michael J. Fox Foundation.
What does it mean to keep showing up?
For people living with Parkinson’s, showing up means facing the morning stiffness, the trembling hand, the frustration of a body that doesn’t always follow instructions — and coming anyway. It means stepping onto a court not knowing if your balance will cooperate, but trusting that someone will be there to steady you if it doesn’t. That someone will
see
you.
Pickleball for Parkinson’s
started with a few people, a few paddles, and a lot of hope. It’s grown into something rare: a space where joy and difficulty coexist, where every missed shot is met with encouragement, and every small win is celebrated like a championship point.
.
All proceeds go toward:
* Weekly clinics for people living with Parkinson’s
* Equipment, court space, and volunteer support
* Expansion to more locations across NYC
* Contributions to the
Michael J. Fox Foundation
for Parkinson’s research
If you’ve ever play
ed at one of our clinics, you know what makes it different: the feeling that no one’s alone out there. That every person matters. That showing up is the win.
So come play. Come laugh.
And if the experience moves you — like it has for so many — come back.
Be a partner. Be a volunteer. Be part of something built to outlast us all.

We never imagined we’d be here—our savings gone, homes refinanced, and now facing shutoff notices just to keep the lights on. After seven years of serving Kalamazoo with pride, we’re at risk of losing everything. We achieved our goal of paying the utilities, now we need to chip away at our back rent of $40,000.  Smokin’ Dutchman BBQ would love to cater your events, feed your family and friends and ultimately give back to our community's non-profits.
But we believe in a God who restores, and with your help, this story doesn’t have to end here.
In 2018, we opened our doors with nothing but hope, excitement, and a whole lot of smoked meat. From day one, it’s been about giving back—donating catering for school auctions, supporting local sports teams, putting ads in school plays. If the community asked, we said “yes.” Always with a smile. Because for us, it has always been about serving people first.
But today, Smokin’ Dutchman BBQ is at a critical crossroads. Without immediate help, our future is in jeopardy.
Here’s how you can help keep Smokin’ Dutchman alive:
✅Donate to help us catch up on rent and utilities.
✅Dine with us and bring your family and friends.
✅Hire us to cater your next event—from tailgates to weddings, we’re here to serve.
✅Share this story so more people in Kalamazoo know what’s at stake.
This hardship stems from pre-petition debt tied to our former three expansion stores, which we closed in order to restructure and provide financial strength moving forward to negotiate with our creditors. These debts are not from our current restaurant but remain tied to us.  If our luck couldn't get any worse, we had a grease fire at the restaurant on May 17th, which forced us to close and remediate for almost 2 months.
The difficulties began under the Dickey’s BBQ Pit franchise. As reported in the New York Times (June 3, 2025), Dickey’s exploited owners through hidden costs, threats, and unprofitable business models. Like so many others, we poured our retirement into staying afloat, only to find ourselves buried under debt, legal threats that arrived more often than birthday cards, and stress no family should ever carry.
We filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy—only to learn it’s expensive to tell people you don’t have money. So, we exited it, choosing instead to take the hard road: working with creditors directly and negotiating to pay back what we can. It’s not the easy way, but it’s the right way. It’s how we were raised—to work hard, to respect others, and to honor God by doing the right thing.
On June 13, 2025, we became proudly independent: Smokin’ Dutchman BBQ.
And here’s what this fight is really about: people.
✅Megan, our Pit Master, who will one day share in ownership because she believes in what we’re building—alongside her daughter and niece who work with her.
✅John, who dreams of one day opening his own place, and his niece, whom he gets to work with every day.
✅The high school students who got their first jobs with us and came back to work summers after college.
✅Our own children, who worked in the restaurant knowing they were helping their parents hold onto a dream.
This has always been about community, opportunity, and creating something bigger than ourselves. We’ve called Kalamazoo home for more than 50 years, and we want to keep giving back to the city that has given us so much.
Our vision for Smokin’ Dutchman BBQ is to bless this community even more:
✅A community platform where local families can showcase their backyard BBQ recipes and share them with Kalamazoo.
✅A catering program that not only feeds events but also helps inspire and mentor new food entrepreneurs—supporting the next generation of local restaurants and food trucks.
✅Locally sourced food—from Michigan-raised meats and Jack's Blend Rubs in Hudsonville, to baked goods from Schultz Sweets.
✅A BBQ menu that honors tradition while adding new twists—featuring a local family’s backyard BBQ every month.
That’s our dream. But right now? We need help just to survive.
Every single dollar, every meal purchased, every event catered, every prayer, and every share makes a difference. Together, we can keep the pits burning at Smokin’ Dutchman BBQ, spark the next wave of Kalamazoo’s food entrepreneurs, and show the power of a God who restores.
We believe the best is still ahead.
Thank you for your love, kindness, prayers, and support through these past 7 years.

As a **Cranial Prosthesis Specialist**, I am dedicating my career to supporting individuals experiencing medical hair loss due to conditions such as alopecia, chemotherapy treatments, and other health-related challenges.
Up until now, I have been serving my clients virtually — providing consultations and education on cranial prosthesis for medical hair loss , and emotional support from a distance. While this has been effective, I am incredibly excited to share that I’ve been offered an amazing opportunity to take the next step: opening a **physical medical office space** where I can serve patients **in person** alongside a growing, supportive team.
This office space will allow us to:
* **Offer private, safe, and welcoming consultations** for clients who need one-on-one support.
* **Properly fit and style cranial prosthetics** in a hands-on setting with full privacy and care.
* **Build confidence and emotional support** through a more personal, face-to-face experience.
* **Host community support events and educational sessions** for patients and their families.
* **Accept medical insurance**, making services more accessible to those in need.
* **Serve our veterans**, who deserve the highest level of care and dignity in their healing journey.
However, to bring this vision to life, I need your help.
The opportunity is here, but the **funds are not readily available**. I am currently seeking financial support to cover the **initial down payment and first month’s rent** for this medical office. This space represents more than just a building — it is a **safe haven** where patients can feel whole again, where healing meets hope, and where every person can walk out feeling crowned in confidence.
With your donation, no matter the size, you are helping me and my team make a lasting impact in the lives of those who need it most. You’re not just funding a space — you’re **helping people reclaim their identity, dignity, and beauty**.
This is just the beginning of something truly powerful, and with your help, **Crownz Heavenly Palace** will soon open its doors to provide even greater care, compassion, and transformation.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for believing in me and the mission of Crownz Heavenly Palace. Let’s build this palace together.

I'm Edward Uhler and I run
Heavy Cardboard
, a YouTube channel and podcast that teaches, plays, and discusses medium and heavy board games. I've been hosting the show for 11 years total and running it as my full-time job for about 8 of those years. Over the life of the show, we have produced over 2,000 videos and podcasts for the board gaming hobby.
The studio is located just outside of Boston, Massachusetts, in the town of Wakefield. Recently, I have been informed that the building is scheduled for demolition and that we need to be out by September 1st.
This was completely unexpected, and it has put me and Heavy Cardboard in quite the difficult position.
I make my living by hosting Heavy Cardboard, but while it pays the bills, it certainly does not make enough to be able to afford an unexpected teardown and move. Simply put, I can't afford to move Heavy Cardboard. The greater Boston area is, unfortunately, an expensive part of the country to live in. Moving from here isn't an option as my whole life is here (my partner & family and our game group), so here we are.
I am trying to raise a total of $19,000 which will cover the following things:
1st month's rent, Last month's rent, and the security deposit on the space
1 year's difference in rent between the current location and the new location
Moving expenses
The cost of materials to setup the new studio
Any funds above the goal will be used to upgrade the studio (lights, camera, etc).
Hosting Heavy Cardboard has been a very surreal experience, and I feel very fortunate to be able to do this on a daily basis. So while this has been a very stressful (and honestly scary) situation, I am keeping a positive attitude and hope that, with your help, Heavy Cardboard will continue.
Thank you for whatever support that you are able to provide.
****Edit: Wow, the original funding goal was met during the Kickoff Live-stream, and thru everyone's recommendations, they suggested to keep building on for upgrades to the studio & an emergency fund, so that's why the funding goal is higher than the original.

In addition, a serious security incident at his shop has placed even greater strain on his business. Despite these challenges, Freddie’s heart remains with the community, and his greatest wish is to continue offering support, mentorship, and safe spaces for the Middletown Community & its youth.
The funds raised through this campaign will go directly toward helping Freddie keep his doors open to the community, continue his nonprofit community outreach, and ensure that local families and children receive the care and support they’ve come to depend on.
Freddie has given so much of himself to Middletown for decades.  Now, it’s our turn to show him that his community stands behind him.  Any contribution, big or small, will help Freddie continue his mission of service, love, and resilience.",2840,25.0,"Audio equipment, Eyewear, Glasses, Vision Care, Electronic device"

Help Retro Vixen Boutique Continue Spreading Love and Style!
Hi, I’m Melissa Evans, the proud owner of Retro Vixen Boutique. When we opened our doors in 2010, I could never have imagined how much this little boutique would grow and evolve. What started as a space for affordable, retro-inspired fashion has blossomed into a vibrant and inclusive community. Today, we proudly serve people of all ages, sizes, genders, and backgrounds, offering unique and stylish fashion that makes everyone feel beautiful and accepted.
Retro Vixen isn’t just a store—it’s a place where customers can express their personal style and embrace who they truly are. Whether you’re shopping for vintage-inspired pieces or simply looking for something that fits your personality, we want every person who walks through our doors to feel celebrated and empowered.
But as we all know, the past few years have been tough. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve faced a series of financial challenges that have left us struggling to stay afloat. Here’s a glimpse of the hurdles we’ve encountered:
COVID-19: We were forced to close our doors, but we kept paying our employees and rent to support our team during this time.
Renovations: We invested thousands into upgrading the store to attract more customers, but unfortunately, we haven’t been able to recover that investment.
2024 Struggles: A 44% drop in sales last year led me to put $50,000 of my own money into keeping the boutique running.
Now, in 2025, we face even more challenges. Inflation is rising, tariffs are driving up costs, and our suppliers in the UK are raising prices.
For example, an order that used to cost $1,000 is now $1,600 due to tariffs.
This means these items will be have to be priced significantly higher- something we simply can’t justify when so many of our customers are struggling.
This is where we need your help. We’re asking for donations to:
Cover the added costs of tariffs so we can keep prices affordable.
Replenish our inventory so we can continue offering the styles you love.
Pay off existing small business loans and operating expenses, including rent, payroll, and bills. We’ve had to cut back on staff hours, but with your support, we hope to reinstate those hours and get our team back to full strength.
Retro Vixen has always been a community-focused business, and we believe that with your help, we can continue to be a space where everyone feels welcome and stylish. Your support will make a world of difference, and we are so incredibly grateful for anything you can contribute.
Thank you for being part of this journey with us. We couldn’t do it without you.
Some reviews from our customers that make us want to show up each and every day!
I started off as a shy curious shopper from St. Joe, I've grown to be one of Retro Vixen's biggest supporters. The level of comfort and safety you feel when you walk in the store is unmatched. You're home, and you're seen. Body positivity is a big deal here, and these ladies have seen me through all my changes. They support the LGBTQIA+ and Black Lives Matter communities, and are everything we should strive to be in the female empowerment community - build each other up, don't tear each other down. Their new secondhand clothing program is also amazing. About 80% of my wardrobe & accessories are from Retro Vixen, and I'm proud to have morphed from a shy, curious shopper into a full on supportive friend that's even modeled a little for them!
My first visit to Retrovixen was in 2018, just after ending a really long and hard relationship. Jess, greeted me with a big “hello darling” and offered assistance right away. I was nervous because I had never been in a store like that and felt like maybe I didn’t belong. But Jess made me feel welcome. She helped me pick out my first dress, that I still own and wear frequently.
Now, shopping at retrovixen is like home. I have gotten to know Jess, Melissa and the other sweet women who pick up shifts from time to time. Retrovixen has been more than a store for me. Retrovixen gives back. They give back by sometimes donating proceeds to good causes. They are extremely vocal about their commitment to diversity and inclusion. They have even helped me out when my dog was nearly dying.
Their smiles and friendly hellos are genuine. Of course, I can’t forget the adorable unique pieces they have. They sell a lot of pinup and rockabilly style pieces that I adore. They have the funnest earrings!! And recently they started to buy and sell second hand pieces.
I love this shop and will always support them as best as I can!
Retro Vixen has been a hot pink sanctuary over the years. My relationship with my body has always been complicated and my weight has fluctuated due to disordered eating and diet culture. Though my body has changed, Jess and Melissa have always been supportive and helped experiment with my style. I’m so grateful that I have a healthier relationship with food and my body, and the role Retro Vixen played in my journey has been invaluable! They’ve helped me celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, job promotions, and days that end in Y. Retro Vixen isn’t just a store, it’s a community and for me it was a lifeline, and no trip to KC is complete without a stop.",4081,29.0,"Facial expression, Cartoon, Poster, Illustration, Animation"

My business has allowed me to help people who truly care about their vehicles but don’t always have the time to keep them clean. For many of my clients, having their car detailed is one less thing to worry about in their busy lives.
Unfortunately, my detailing trailer was stolen early Thursday morning. The trailer carried all the equipment and products I need to serve my clients, including power tools, cleaning supplies, and specialized detailing gear. Without these tools, I haven’t been able to work, and it’s been a major setback for my main source of income.
I’m raising funds to replace my trailer and the essential equipment so I can get back to helping my clients and supporting myself.

In February 2023 I had a tumor removed at Roswell Park and was diagnosed with lung cancer. Thank God they caught it early; it was contained and they got it out. I have been a comic book collector for over 40 years and was devastated when my favorite comic book store Pulp 716 was closing the end of October 2023. It was always my dream to open my own comic book store so I looked into leasing the building that Pulp 716 had used. I started leasing the property January 1, 2024 and March 31, 2024 was the grand opening of Russkull's Comics and Collectibles. So many customers commented they were so glad that I reopened as a comic book store. It has been great interacting with customers who shared my passion for comic books. The store also participated in the Easter Trail down Main Street in Lockprt and the Downtown Trick or Treat where we handed out candy and free comic books. Both events were huge turnouts and it was great getting involved with the community. In November 2024 Roswell Park found a new tumor in my other lung. They removed it and it was cancerous but again contained. The store lost business when it was closed while I had surgery and when we had shorter hours while I was recovering. On April 5, 2025 the store celebrated our One Year Anniversary. On April 19, 2025 we started selling bubble tea which was very popular with Pulp 716. This brought in a whole bunch of new customers who commented that they were glad we brought back the bubble tea. Then in June 2025 our distributor, Diamond Comics, went bankrupt and could not fill July orders and stopped delivering new comics by the end of June. The store lost business during the time we did not receive our new weekly comics while we switched to a new distributor. We are finally back on track with our weekly deliveries but business has been very slow. We will not be able to to stay in business without some help. I have no other resources available and am appealing to the community and comic book lovers everywhere. I really feel that Russkull's Comics and Collectibles is a vital resource being the only comic book store in Niagara County. My goal is to raise $5,000 to get caught up with bills and rent. I would also like to purchase more product to expand our bubble tea menu along with some tables and chairs to make the customers more comfortable. The store has over 250 followers on Facebook and if each one donates $10 we will be half way to our goal. We really need everyone's help to keep our small shop alive. So many customers have commented on how much they like our store. It would break my heart to lose my dream and have to close. PLEASE DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!!

The Ottmer family has been feeding communities in our hill country since 1855, when Governor Sam Houston signed their 1000 acre land grant on the edge of Fredericksburg. 170 years later, 6th generation farmer Bradley Ottmer has been farming his 93 acres where he was born and raised, driving his first tractor at age 5! ""OPA's farm"" was its name, now called Hat & Heart Farm. Here he and his parents have provided tons of vegetables, meat goats, turkeys, and currently 1000 chickens.
Bradley sells his organic foods at local farmer's markets and supplies restaurants - including the fabulous Leaning Pear.
Last May a powerful storm tore the tin roof off of his barn which then smashed into his large greenhouse and destroyed it. Since then, he has been growing his crops in the field, but needs the greenhouse for fall and winter plantings.
Bradley found a suitable used greenhouse to purchase, however he needs $6500 plus the help of some willing folks to move it and get it set up.

Our mission is to strengthen the physical, mental and emotional health of our east side community through fitness, entrepreneurship, and lifestyle education.
Why We Need Your Support
We are nearly ready to open our doors. However, before the City of Whitehall grants occupancy approval, a few required renovations and safety upgrades must be completed.
Project Breakdown – $30,500 Needed
Seal & Stripe Parking Lot (36 spaces) – $12,000
Exterior Signage (Black Awning) – $7,500
Commercial Garage Door Installation – $5,500
Security System (cameras & alarms) – $5,500
Total Required: $30,500
Your support directly funds these improvements so we can open safely, legally and with the visibility needed to serve our community.
Transparency & Resilience
“We lead this journey with honesty as one of the keys to connecting directly to our vital communityLike many entrepreneurs, we trusted a local contractor who came across as reputable but failed to deliver as promised. This caused delays and unexpected costs.

I have never felt so compelled to walk into a building and give them my business. Upon talking to the owner I found out that he has not only been serving his community, but the hungry free of charge for the last 15 years!! Not only this but he told me the next day, Sunday August 31st, 2025 was his last day before getting kicked out of his building so another business could expand.. and he couldn’t afford to move into a new one..
This didn’t sit right with me so I made a tiktok, and the rest is history. Max not only touched my heart that day but over 1 million other people who wanted to do whatever they could to help! So I went back on his last day and asked him what he wanted his future to look like. He told me making food for people is his passion and his dream would be to open another restaurant if he could afford it..
This is where we, as a community come in. Max has spent his life not only keeping people fed, but clearly changing the lives of every person he comes across. He is so selfless and it’s time for all of his good karma to come back around.

Over the past three years, I have poured my ""blood, sweat, and tears"" into growing Elk Rock Yoga with a clear mission: to support all bodies through a practice that embraces all peoples, beliefs, and abilities.
That mission took an exciting new form with the opening of Elk Rock Yoga’s sister space, Elk Rock Outpost, at 2205 E Burnside. Officially launched on Memorial Day Weekend 2025, the Outpost was created as more than a retail shop—it is a carefully curated haven designed to inspire an artful life. The space offers a diverse selection of carefully sourced products that reflect my dedication to wellness and community:
Consumables: Delicious treats and pantry staples for everyday nourishment
Wellness and Self-Care Items: Products that nurture mind, body, and spirit
Vintage Finds and Gifts: Unique treasures and meaningful gifts
Every item at the Outpost is chosen through direct collaborations with artisans, makers, farmers, and growers, ensuring that each piece promotes ease, beauty, and well-being.
Beyond retail, the Outpost serves as a vibrant community hub, featuring workshops, live music, and gatherings that promote connection and creativity.
This project is particularly meaningful to me as I've been bringing it to life while simultaneously managing health challenges following a diagnosis and treatment for advanced stage endometrial cancer. As I channel my energy into this new venture, continue the operation of my yoga studio, and navigate numerous appointments during my recovery, I am seeking your support.
Elk Rock Outpost is centrally located on a busy street in Portland's Kerns neighborhood, surrounded by fantastic food. Our customers appreciate our unique gifts, warm atmosphere, and engaging events. I have poured everything I have into creating this beautiful space, and now I am asking for your support as it continues to grow.
Please consider making a donation. Any amount you can contribute will truly help celebrate overcoming cancer and get this business firmly on its feet.
Thank you for your support.

CAMPAIGN STORY
WE GOT THE KEYS!
After months of planning, saving, and all-out hustle — BAMF Design Studio has officially secured its first commercial space.
But this didn’t happen overnight.
Amy started BAMF in August of 2022 — squeezing it in after her day job, staying up late, grinding through weekends, and sacrificing family time to build something real from scratch. For nearly three years, she ran the business solo — designing, packing, filming, answering emails, and showing up on every livestream with that signature BAMF energy, even when she was running on fumes.
This brand was built one order at a time. One customer at a time. One late night at a time.
In August of 2024, Amy finally left her 9–5 to go full-time with BAMF. Eight months later, in April 2025, I (Kaleb) joined full-time to support the growth and free up Amy to focus on expansion.
Since then, we’ve doubled down.
Launched new livestream formats, including private subscriber shows
Added new equipment, including a laser engraver
Opened up travel vlog content to connect beyond the workspace
Expanded product lines, added more stock, and introduced BAMF Boxes
Built deeper connections with our customers through content, chaos, and consistency
The growth has been real. But it’s come with a cost. Right now, BAMF is taking over our house. Literally. Our two biggest rooms are workspaces. The kitchen is lined with product. The library is storage. The playroom is a shipping zone. The hallways are obstacle courses of boxes. We can’t relax. It doesn’t feel like a home anymore.
We’re proud of what BAMF has become — but it simply doesn’t fit inside these walls anymore. The business grew, but the house stayed the same, and something had to give. It was time to either cap the growth... or move to a bigger pot.
So we started looking. Calling. Emailing. Touring buildings. Crunching numbers. And on September 25, 2025, we got the keys to our new studio: A 1,650 sq ft commercial warehouse with dedicated office space!
We did a public walkthrough with our customers the same day. It’s real. It’s empty. And it’s ours. Now, we just need to make it BAMF.
WHAT THIS FUNDRAISER COVERS
We’re not asking because we can’t do this on our own — BAMF has always paid for itself. But so many of you have asked how to help without placing another order or adding to our workload, so we’re opening this space for those who want to contribute directly to the next chapter.
Here’s what your support will help us bring to life:
Deep Cleaning & Prep: The space has been sitting vacant. Before anything moves in, it needs a full deep clean — floors, vents, surfaces — so we can start fresh.
Lighting Upgrades & Fixture Improvements: With power active, we’ll be replacing outdated fixtures, improving visibility across the warehouse, and making sure the lighting supports livestreams, admin work, and long-haul production days.
Workspace Furniture & Storage: This studio is over 3x bigger than our current space. We need modular workbenches, storage, shelving, and clean organization to scale effectively.
Shipping Station Buildout: We’re building a real fulfillment zone — label printers, pack stations, shelving, and supply caddies — to streamline how we ship and serve.
Livestream & Content Studio Setup: We’re upgrading to a professional content studio with quality lighting, cameras, sound, and space flexibility to take livestreams and BTS content to the next level.
️ Admin Station: A designated admin zone with computers, monitors, and peripherals for design work, moderation, scheduling, and customer support.
Every dollar goes directly toward building a professional, scalable, sustainable BAMF Studio — not for extras, not for fluff — just the essentials that help us deliver better quality, faster service, and more room to grow.

I’m 10 years old and I’ve loved fossils and natural history my entire life. After visiting the Staffin Dinosaur Museum while vacationing with my family in Scotland in 2022, I knew I wanted to open a museum of my own someday. With the help of my family, my community, and a lot of generous people from around the country,
that dream became real on August 9th, 2024.
I attended many village board meetings and met with the village administrator many times about my dream of opening a museum, which resulted in the Village of Cambridge kindly letting me use an old building free of charge to get started. On opening day, I started with a single display case of fossils and artifacts. The collection has since grown to fill eleven cases and the museum has welcomed hundreds of visitors from around the world. We regularly host school and daycare field trip groups, and it’s been amazing to see how many people are excited to learn about natural history right here in our small town.
I have been overwhelmed with the generosity I have experienced this past year and want to do everything I can to fulfill my promise to those who have lovingly donated fossils, minerals, artifacts, and more to the museum and ensure these items will be displayed for years to come.
This is where I need your help!
My goal is to raise $50,000 to purchase and renovate the building the museum currently occupies.
Your donation will help:
Secure a permanent home for the museum in Cambridge, IL
Restore and preserve the building’s brick exterior
Finish the upstairs space and convert it into a short-term rental to help support the museum financially and provide much-needed temporary lodging in the area
Update and repair the museum space, and create a small gift shop for visitors
If you believe in the power of curiosity, education, and young people chasing big dreams, I hope you’ll consider donating. Every dollar brings us closer to making the museum a permanent part of Cambridge.
Thank you so much for your support!
– Anderson

Inspired by my dad and grandma, I started young, and wrestling gave me the discipline to push through challenges. I became a 3x state champion at Omaha North and a national champion in college. Those lessons in hard work shaped me and built the character I rely on today.
I worked many years at Leavenworth Café, where I learned patience and gained the vision to start my own business. In May 2025, I quit my job at the county to take a leap of faith to cook full time. Since then, I have been doing everything on my own. Life has tested me, but I am determined to make this dream a reality.
This past July, I offered Omaha Police “Lt. Dan” a plate of food while he was patrolling nearby. That small act sparked a friendship and showed me how food can break down barriers and bring people together. It reminded me why I love doing this: food has the power to unite us, no matter our background.
I have put everything I have into this dream, but I need help to take the next step. A food truck costs $8,000, and I have already saved half. With your support, I can reach my goal, expand Omaha’s food options, and provide for my family while giving back to the community.

They still cater event,https://images.gofundme.com/tenDGMuORPc_F9loZZXnkt2mKso=/1200x900/https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/95019371_175901290615696_r.jpeg,"**Help Verde Cocina Recover from a Devastating Betrayal**
As a proud member of the small business community in Oregon and SW Washington, I’m heartbroken to share the story of an unimaginable betrayal — one that’s shaken a family-run local favorite to its core.
The Garnica family, owners of Verde Cocina, one of Portland’s most beloved organic, locally sourced restaurants and caterers, have been an essential part of our community for over 16 years. As a wedding venue, we've worked with Verde Cocina for a decade and have seen firsthand the love, integrity, and excellence they bring to every event and every meal.
But now — they need us.
What Happened
On September 19th, the Garnicas discovered that a trusted longtime manager had been embezzling funds and committing wire fraud by siphoning off payments meant for the restaurant by linking his own bank account to Verde Cocina’s Square processing system and issuing fake invoices using their logo.
The current estimated loss is nearly $300,000 and that figure only covers what’s been uncovered over the past eight months.
This comes on the heels of another major setback: a fire in 2019 that destroyed their largest location and catering kitchen. The family never asked for help — they rolled up their sleeves and rebuilt on their own. Last year, they were close to reopening… but the money was gone, and they didn’t yet know why.
Now, we do. The PPB has made an arrest and the district attorney is building a case as this is a class B felony and has affected well over a hundred transaction.
Despite Everything, They're Still Showing Up
Even now, Verde Cocina continues to honor catering commitments, delivering food for weddings and events even though they themselves haven’t received the payments, That’s the kind of people they are.
This family is not asking for a handout. In fact, they’re not the ones who started this fundraiser, we are. Because we’ve seen what they do for their staff, customers, and community. Because they would never stop showing up for us — and now it’s our turn to show up for them.
Why This Matters
Verde Cocina employs dozens of people, including multiple generations of families. Their team is like a second home for many and turnover is almost nonexistent.
Here’s what one employee, Elana, shared:
“In 2019, I lost my father suddenly. The Garnicas were heartbroken for me — they wrote me a check to cover my rent and told me to take as much time as I needed. They’ve done the same for countless others. They drain their bank account to help employees, and that’s what makes this betrayal so devastating.”
This isn't just a financial crisis, it's an emotional one. A violation of trust by someone they treated like family.
How You Can Help
Your donation will help:
* Cover the financial loss from the fraud
* Support staff salaries and operations
* Finally reopen their flagship restaurant and catering kitchen
* Ensure they can continue to serve the community with the heart and excellence they’re known for
Every dollar helps. Every share helps. Let’s rally around this incredible family and business just like they’ve always rallied around us.
Thank you for supporting Verde Cocina and the Garnica family.

I’m the heart and hands behind Sweet Tuu’s Cakes & Treats. I’m a single mother of two, a self-taught cake artist, and a woman who has turned pain into purpose. In 2018, I started my business out of my kitchen as a way to heal and to bring joy to others. I love bringing important moments to life by creating custom cakes and treats and making everlasting memories with every bite.
In December 2023, I survived a major car accident that nearly took my life. The vehicle was totaled. Since the accident I have been in and out of work due to lack of reliable transportation and this year alone I have been let go from three jobs. My childcare paperwork was mishandled and that left my son without services. As a single mom, these challenges have taken a toll on my household and my children’s lives.
But through it all, one thing has stayed constant: my calling. I believe God spared me for a reason, and He’s been telling me to step fully into my gifts. After losing another job in August 2025, I made the decision to listen to that still, small voice and focus on Sweet Tuu’s Cakes & Treats full time. By growing my business, I can eliminate childcare costs, create a flexible schedule for my family, and finally build stability doing what I love.
I’m fundraising to invest in equipment, ingredients, licensing, marketing, and reliable transportation so I can take my business to the next level.
Every donation — no matter how small — helps me provide for my children, serve my community, and build a legacy that turns pain into something beautiful.

The Blok has come a long way since we first opened our doors almost 2 years ago. What started as a dream has grown into a real community, and it’s because of all of you that we’ve made it this far. We’re finally starting to round the corner financially, which means we can shift from just keeping the lights on to actually building out the experience our members,
YOU
, deserve.
One of the things people ask about most is extended hours, especially early in the morning. We’d love nothing more than to make that happen, but you all know there's only three (sometimes four) of us to staff the desk around the clock, and 13-14 hours a day already has us all stretched as thin as we can be. BUT... we've done the legwork and found a solution so you can climb whenever it works best for you, whether that’s early before work, late at night, or somewhere in between, and it also lets the Brooks Family retain some amount of ""work"" - life balance.
The only thing standing in the way is the upfront cost of converting the gym to 24/7. We're taking on additional monthly overhead to get these systems in place but, instead of raising membership prices for all of you that have been so loyal to us,
we’re hoping to fund the upfront cost together through this campaign
. Every contribution goes directly toward making 24/7 access a reality. Everyone that is a member before our 24/7 access goes live will be grandfathered in at their current membership rate (see below for clarification).
FOR TRANSPARENCY
All existing members will gain extended access when 24/7 access launches for no additional fee, details for the access for each membership type are below:
Individual
+ Squad
- 24/7 Access
Build Your Own
- 5AM to Midnight on selected days
Early Bird
- Check-in from 5AM to 2PM
PWYC/Health/Industry/Non-member
- 10AM to 8 PM Daily.
**Members CAN bring guests outside of general public hours, but their guest must purchase a day pass and check-in at the kiosk. No guest passes can be used outside of general public hours.**
WHERE IS THIS MONEY GOING?
Door access control hardware - $1,900
Knox box for EMS access - $500
Additional surveillance equipment - $500
Customer management door access integration - $1,200
Member music control kiosk - $400
Total investment cost -
$4,500
We don't want to raise your dues, and 24/7 access will be coming regardless of how much funding we raise from this, but we also know our community would probably like to see this happen as soon as possible, and this GoFundMe serves to get this launched ASAP for you all.
If The Blok has ever felt like your place to hang out, grow stronger, or connect with others, we’d be grateful for your support. Even a small donation helps push us closer to unlocking the doors around the clock.
Thanks for being part of this community and helping us keep building something special together.
Next up after we go 24/7...

Hi everyone! I'm Emily Cancelmo, the owner/founder of Stray By The Bay. Over the past two years, we've worked hard to help rescue cats in Lincoln and surrounding areas with the dream of opening Lincoln's first ever cat cafe. The time has come to make that dream into a reality, but not without
YOUR help!
Stray By The Bay is hoping to open the purr-fect hangout spot
that will bring together the aspects of your favorite coffeeshop alongside the irresistible company of local adoptable felines. We've partnered with several local shelters and rescues to give cats a safe, cage-free, and enriching environment while they wait for their fur-ever homes.
✨What to Expect✨
Locally roasted coffee, teas, and fresh baked good available for purchase in the cafe area
A beach theme throughout the cafe to bring shore vibes to the Midwest
Adoptable cats and kittens from your favorite local rescues and shelters
Multiple monthly events- cat yoga, painting, movie nights, and more
Community Give Back- cat supply pantry, microchip/vaccine clinics, and educational events
Where your donations will go:
Acquisition of a physical space
Permits and licensing
Cafe and cat room renovations
Equipment and supplies
The majority of donations will go towards acquiring the physical location and renovations needed for the cafe. This will include constructing walls to separate the cafe and cat room spaces, as well as making sure both areas are safe and cozy for humans and cats alike. Donations will also help to cover the equipment needed for a fully functional coffee bar and small kitchen to provide guests with fresh drinks, baked goods, and other snacks.
Every donation-big or small-brings us one step closer to opening our doors and saving the lives of countless cats. Whether you're a long time supporter, coffee fan, cat enthusiast, or someone that just loves supporting the community, we'd be so grateful for your help and support.

My name is Shannon.
I am starting this GoFundMe to support Brian & Emily during this difficult time of financial hardships with VIP Barbell. This fundraiser is to help get VIP Barbell up and running on their new property as soon as possible due to unexpected financial obstacles.
Over the past week, Brian & Emily faced an unexpected challenge. They were informed that they won’t receive the full proceeds from the gym sale. While this is no fault of Brian & Emily they will be investing every dollar personally to get this off the ground running. This will also impact the sale of Emily’s house. I am reaching out to invite your support in helping bring this vision to life sooner then later.
VIP Barbell and Brian & Emily have had a huge impact on my life. I’ve been friends with Emily for over 12 years, and she has always been an inspiration to me. Watching her through her fitness journey, especially while dealing with medical challenges that we both understand all too well, gave me the push I needed to finally join the gym back in 2021. From the moment I walked in, Brian made me feel welcomed, supported and pushed me to my limits. I started to feel stronger—not just physically, but mentally and emotionally too. VIP quickly became my happy place. It’s where I have met amazing people and I finally felt like I belonged. That’s why I’m doing this for Brian & Emily who built this community, and for everyone who calls VIP Barbell their home.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian & Emily Reed are the proud owners of VIP Barbell in Newtown, PA. VIP Barbell has never just been a gym to them. It’s their dream, passion and second home. They built a community where lifters of all ages and backgrounds can come together, push their limits and support each other both inside and outside the gym. It’s a place where new lifters find their footing, where seasoned lifters smash their PRs, and where friendships are formed that last far beyond the walls of the gym. They have seen people walk in unsure of themselves and become not only stronger physically, but more confident in every part of their lives. That means everything to them. Members often tell Brian & Emily that the gym is the one place they feel truly at home.
Sadly, like many small businesses, they are facing financial challenges that are forcing them to make a heartbreaking decision of closing the gym in October. This is heartbreaking—not only for Brian & Emily, but also the VIP Barbell family. The thought of losing the community and family is crushing for them.
Let's help them with a new chapter!!!
Their dream is to reopen VIP Barbell on their newly purchased residential property. To bring that vision to life they are building a standalone structure dedicated entirely to strength, focus, and community.
A project like this takes serious commitment. Every dollar possible is being invested personally by Brian & Emily to get this off the ground. I am reaching out to invite your support in helping bring this vision to life.
If VIP Barbell has ever been a place where you felt stronger, supported or inspired—or if you just believe in small businesses that care deeply about their people—I would be forever grateful if you’d consider donating or sharing this story. Every single donation, share, or kind word makes a difference—not just for Emily & Brian, but for the entire VIP Barbell family.
Together, we can make this next chapter happen.
Why We Need Your Help:
Your support will go directly toward:
Building a standalone structure on their residential property
Moving and maintaining equipment
Covering startup costs to get the gym up and running
Every donation—no matter the size—brings them one step closer to rebuilding.
How You Can Help:
Donate to help them build out the new space
Share this story with friends, family, and anyone who believes in supporting small businesses and strong communities
Stay connected—we’ll keep everyone updated on their journey to reopening
VIP Barbell is more than four walls and some weights—it’s people, support, and a place where strength is built in every sense of the word. With your help, we can bring the gym back to life in a new home and keep VIP Barbell thriving. Thank you for your support. It is more appreciated than you will ever know.

My name is Gabi Rivera for the past five years, I’ve been baking cookies and giving them out on a donation basis to help fund Christian education for students in Colombia. By God’s grace and the support of my Tierrasanta Seventh-Day Adventist Church family, that simple act turned into something much bigger — providing 15 full scholarships for students at Colegio Adventista Los Andes.
Now, I’m inviting you to join the next movement!
In just 30 days, we aim to raise $7,000 to bless two schools in two countries:
The first $1,000 for Colegio Adventista Los Andes (Colombia): celebrating their 40th anniversary and moving closer to their dream of a new $12,500 computer lab.
The Next $6,000 for San Diego Academy (California, U.S.): reducing sports fees to increase participation and building a student weight room so every student can become a stronger athlete.
Why “The Lift Initiative”?
Because we are not just lifting weights, we are lifting each other up.
Organized by San Diego Academy ( Principal Thomas) with me, Gabi Rivera, as Founder and leader of The Lift Initiative.
Why We’re Doing This:
At 13 years old, after hearing my grandmother share about students in Colombia who couldn’t afford school, I asked a simple question in the car: “What if I bake cookies and gather donations?”
That small act of faith became a movement. Batch after batch, God multiplied it into over 15 scholarships for students in Colombia. Now, with
The Lift Initiative,
I’m inviting you to help expand this mission — blessing two schools at once.
First goal: $7,000 in 30 days.
After we reach it, every extra dollar will be split 50/50 for both schools’ needs.
Families in Colombia: You can donate with a credit card (note that your bank may charge a small international fee).
Local San Diego donors: I will be visiting local churches with my cookies to collect donations (dates to come), and I’ll keep the GoFundMe updated so everyone can see our progress.
We’d love to hear from you!
When you donate, feel free to share who you are, where you’re from, or just say hello. We want to celebrate our donors and create a connected, global community.
I’ve seen how God can use something as small as a cookie to change lives. My dream is that this project reminds every student — in San Diego and Colombia — that
with God’s help, nothing is impossible.
I also wanted to share what I heard on K-LOVE last week:
“Sometimes we are the answer to someone’s prayer, and sometimes we are the receivers.”
Join The Lift movement, be the answer to someone’s prayer
.
Transparency Note:
All funds raised will go directly into the San Diego Academy account and will be distributed exactly as outlined above — ensuring full accountability and transparency.
Donate & Share:
Thank you for lifting with us! Together, we can bless students in Colombia and San Diego, honor 40 years of God’s faithfulness, and show what happens when one heart says ""Yes!"" to serving.

We employ cutting-edge modalities: an Ultra Low Magnetic Field MRI, advanced EEG, and SynOne skin biopsy (for Parkinson’s/Lewy body). These tools help us detect changes early, monitor treatment response, and tailor care.
Our ambition is to accelerate the time from consultation → diagnosis → therapy, offering evidence-based strategies and, when appropriate, anti-amyloid therapies. We also participate in research trials and plan to expand our own translational research.
Why this new building matters
We purchased a facility to centralize our operations. To fully realize this vision, we need to renovate and build out several critical areas: exam rooms, MRI suite, infusion / therapy bays (2–3 chairs), and support spaces. The goal is not only functional — we want spaces that are warm, welcoming, and dignified for patients and caregivers at every stage.
How your donation helps
Funds raised will be dedicated exclusively to capital improvements and facility build-out (e.g. construction, infrastructure, medical-equipment installations, furniture, HVAC, shielding).
No funds will be used for routine operating expenses (e.g. staff payroll, clinical supplies, or patient care).
Your contribution helps us expand access to high-caliber Alzheimer’s diagnostics and care — in a single, patient-friendly location. Thank you for helping us build a future where fewer families must suffer the fragmented journey across multiple providers.",170,,"Pink, Petal, Blossom, Clip art, Graphics"

My name is
Chef B
, and for years I’ve poured my heart, soul, and strength into building a legacy through food. This business has never just been about cooking — it has been about serving, creating memories, and showing love through every plate and every event.
I have never asked for help to this capacity before. By the grace of God, I’ve worked with my own two hands — even when I was broke, brokenhearted, grieving, or unsure of the next step — to make sure that my clients experienced joy, excellence, and unforgettable moments. I’ve sacrificed to ensure others had what they needed, even when I barely had enough myself.
Now, for the first time, I am humbly asking for support.
Why I’m Asking Now
My business has already launched and thrived, but the truth is — financially, it’s been a major struggle to keep momentum flowing. Steady income has been inconsistent, and while I’ve managed to carry this vision this far, I cannot build the next phase alone.
Your support will go directly into:
•	Hosting taste-testing events that will showcase my food and build community.
•	Launching cooking classes to teach, inspire, and empower others in the kitchen.
•	Investing in new equipment and business tools to serve with greater excellence, whether it's kitchen equipment, seasoning ingredients, bottles, or labels.
This is not a handout — it’s a seed. A seed into good ground.
Why This Matters
Food has a way of healing, connecting, and inspiring. My calling is to use this gift to serve people in ways that go beyond a plate — to touch lives, spark joy, and create lasting memories.
When you sow into
Chef B
’s vision, you’re not just supporting a business. You’re helping build a kingdom legacy. You’re helping create spaces where people are celebrated, where community is built, and where excellence shines as a testimony of God’s faithfulness.
How You Can Sow Into This Vision
To honor your generosity, I’ve created ways to thank and acknowledge everyone who joins me in this journey:

✔️ Your name honored on my Founder’s Board displayed at my first major event/class
Final Words From My Heart
This is not easy for me to write. For years, I have built with nothing but faith, my hands, and God’s strength. But I know even visionaries need community. I believe God places people in our paths who are meant to stand with us, sow with us, and build with us.
Your support
— whether big or small — is a confirmation that this vision is worth it, that this work matters, and that together we can do something greater than I could do alone.
If you’ve ever tasted my food, experienced my service, or simply believed in me, I ask you to prayerfully consider sowing into this vision. Every seed planted here will grow into something that will bless many.
“Now unto Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.”
— Ephesians 3:20
“But my God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.”
— Philippians 4:19
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you for believing in me, standing with me, and helping me carry this vision into the future.

Baking has been my safe place. A few years ago, I went through one of the most painful and traumatic seasons of my life. In the middle of it all, I found myself in the kitchen — measuring, stirring, creating. Somewhere between the butter, sugar, and flour, I found a way to heal. Baking became more than recipes; it became therapy.
Today, I carry that same hope into the lives of others. I work at the Fisher House, where military families stay while their loved ones receive care. It’s an honor to serve them, and one of the ways I do that is through a little program I started called “Cookies with the Chaplain.” Every week I bring in cookies to share, sometimes paying out of my own pocket, because I’ve seen what something as small as a cookie can do — it breaks the ice, softens heavy hearts, and reminds people they’re not alone.
Now, I’m ready to take what baking has done for me and create something bigger: a pop-up bakery space. A place filled with warmth, color, and sweets that carry a story of resilience and joy.
The funds raised will go directly toward:
•	Decorating and bringing the pop-up space to life
•	Stocking it with baked goods and display items
•	Purchasing the supplies and tools needed to keep things running
This isn’t just a business dream — it’s a chance to spread hope, one dessert at a time.
If you feel led to support, know that you’re not just helping me open a pop-up; you’re helping me continue a journey of healing, and hopefully sparking healing in others too.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

As you know, disasters can strike at any time, putting small businesses at risk. LiftFund is committed to supporting them through any crisis. Small businesses support over 57 million workers in the U.S. and their families. Together, we can ensure they have the meaningful support they need in their time of greatest need.
LiftFund, a nonprofit community funder headquartered in San Antonio, TX, has supported small businesses and community recovery caused by natural disasters and business interruptions dating back to Hurricane Katrina.
This year, LiftFund supported the Hill Country’s recovery from the tragic floods and the Los Angeles community's recovery from the devastating fires. We can't help business owners like Brian, Brandi and Amanda in Hill Country without your help!
Small businesses often are the first to respond by serving as centers for communities in crisis, providing food and resources that are critical in the moment. Rapid funding is essential to ensure communities come back stronger by keeping small businesses open and retaining employees through supported financial recovery and compassionate support from the LiftFund team.
We appreciate you!

Back in 2020 I started Red Bird Media. At the time it was just me, a camera, and a conviction that God created me to be creative, to tell His stories through the lives of others. What started as a simple act of faith has grown into a calling that has carried me across the country.
Who we are
: Red Bird Media is built on faith, family, and fire. It’s about documenting the brotherhood of the fire service, the families who stand behind them, and the sacrifices that deserve to be remembered. This isn’t just about cameras, it’s about community, and it’s about making sure no firefighter or family ever has to pay to be remembered.
What we do
: Over the past few years I’ve been blessed to travel to Texas, St. Louis, Louisville, Indiana, Florida, New York, and Boston, with more stops to come. At each conference and event, I’ve been able to capture and share stories of the firehood family, not as a business transaction, but as a gift. Everything we create is given freely, because these stories matter more than money.
Why we’re asking
: The next step is purchasing a camper. This isn’t about comfort, it’s about calling. The camper will serve as both a rest station and a portable studio, keeping me self-sufficient on the road. That means conferences don’t have to use valuable resources to host me, and it allows me to keep giving content away freely. It will let me show up wherever I’m needed, stay present, and pour everything back into the firehood family.
How you can be part of this
: Supporting this mission is not just about donating, it’s about joining the community. Every prayer, every word of encouragement, and every contribution of any size makes you part of Red Bird Media. We want to carry that with us, so we’re inviting supporters to add their family names, company logos, or personal marks to the camper itself, a rolling reminder of the people who helped make this possible. We’ll also share posts and updates along the way, showing our gratitude and highlighting the community that fuels this mission.
Every single contribution matters
. Every dollar, every prayer, every word of encouragement will be fully honored and poured back into telling these stories. For those who feel led to give significantly, your name or logo will travel with us, seen across the country as a visible sign of the people who helped turn this dream into reality.
Red Bird Media is not just my story, it’s our story. Together we can continue to tell stories of faith, family, and fire with dignity, without burden, and always pointing back to the One who gave me this purpose.
With faith and honor,
Daniel Purcell

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by the tiny worlds of insects — how they build, survive, and interact in ways that are surprisingly similar to us. That passion has inspired me to design a simulator where players can step into the shoes (or legs!) of a bug and experience life from their perspective.
This game will let players:
Explore realistic environments from a bug’s point of view.
Survive challenges like predators, weather, and finding food.
Build and grow a colony or live as a lone survivor.
Learn fun facts about real insect behaviors along the way.
I want this project to be more than just a game — it’s a way to spark curiosity about nature and show how amazing the smallest creatures really are.
I’m asking for support to help cover the costs of development tools, art, sound design, and the time it takes to bring this vision to life. Every donation, big or small, helps me get one step closer to launching the bug world I’ve always dreamed of creating.
If you’ve ever looked at a bug and wondered what life is like for them, this game will give you the chance to find out. Thank you for supporting me and helping bring this buggy adventure to life!",255,7.0,Orange

I’m Carol, the founder of Hit-the-Web Marketing. For years, I’ve poured my heart into helping construction companies, eCommerce shops, and local small businesses grow online. I believe every hardworking business deserves to have a clear, predictable, and reliable way to attract customers — and that’s been my mission.
But right now, my own business is at risk.
I’m facing overwhelming bills and expenses that I simply can’t keep up with on my own. I’ve been doing everything possible — substitute teaching, consulting, and freelancing — but it’s not enough to cover both my personal obligations and the marketing dollars needed to keep Hit-the-Web running.
Without urgent help, I risk losing the business I’ve worked so hard to build.
What Happened
This past year, I was told I had to leave my apartment. Rent in my area skyrocketed from $1,400 to $2,250 a month — a 60% increase.
It took six difficult months to find a new place and move. That transition ate up not only my savings, but also valuable time I would have spent building my business.
On top of that, my cat Maggie became sick and needed urgent vet care. She’s family to me, and while I don’t regret making sure she was treated, it pulled more money away from my business.
Between moving, higher housing costs, and vet bills, my business had to take a back seat. Now I’m working hard to rebuild Hit-the-Web Marketing, and this GoFundMe will help cover marketing costs, overdue bills, and rent so I can get back on track.
Why This Matters
Saving Hit-the-Web isn’t just about me. It’s about the many small businesses, non-profits, and entrepreneurs who rely on my work to:
•	Grow their online presence
•	Generate consistent sales
•	Compete against bigger companies with bigger budgets
I know the difference that good marketing makes — I’ve seen small businesses go from struggling to thriving because of it. But without support, I may lose the very business that helps others grow.
How Your Support Will Be Used
Your support will go directly toward:
1.	Marketing for Hit-the-Web Marketing – building visibility, running campaigns, and attracting new clients so the business can stand strong again.
2.	Rent support – covering the 60% increase that has drained my resources.
3.	Back expenses – catching up on overdue bills (utilities, business tools, basic living costs) that piled up during the six-month housing transition.
4.	Stability cushion – creating a small safety net so I don’t fall behind again and can focus fully on helping small businesses grow.
How You Can Help
1.	Donate what you can — even $10 makes a difference.
2.	Share this campaign with your friends, family, and networks.
3.	If you own a business, consider working with me so your support goes both ways.
I’ve always believed in lifting others up, and now I’m humbly asking for help to get through this season. With your support, I can rebuild after this setback and keep Hit-the-Web Marketing alive — not just for me, but for the businesses who count on me.
From the bottom of my heart — thank you.

For almost 20 years, I’ve trained in the Art of Aikido and have been deeply connected to a community that has shaped me physically, mentally, and spiritually. Many of you know me from the mat, as a student, training partner, and friend.
Nine months ago, I took a leap of faith and launched my own small business: a private, in-home personal training and nutrition service designed to help people take control of their health in a sustainable, meaningful way. This work is my passion, blending discipline, care, and the principles of Aikido to support others in becoming stronger, more resilient versions of themselves.
It’s been both an exciting and challenging journey.
I’ve been building everything from the ground up, training clients, managing every detail of the business, and steadily growing through word of mouth. But as the business begins to expand, so do the growing pains. I’ve reached a point where I need support to take the next step and serve more people at a higher level.
Why I’m Asking for Help
I’ve always valued hard work, independence, and service. It’s not easy for me to ask for help, but I’ve learned that asking doesn’t mean weakness. It means believing in the vision enough to let others be part of it.
I’m raising funds to invest in professional equipment and tools that I can bring to my client’s homes, as well as for my in-home studio space.
This will allow me to:
· Provide safer, more effective training experiences for clients
· Expand my offerings to meet increasing demand
· Improve the overall quality and professionalism of my services
These upgrades will make a real, direct impact in the lives of the people I train, many of whom come to me during transitional or vulnerable times, seeking strength, healing, and confidence.
Why It Matters
This isn’t just about growing a business. It’s about continuing a mission to help people feel better in their bodies, find clarity in their lives, and experience the kind of personal transformation I’ve seen through Aikido and mindful movement.
If you’ve ever trained with me, shared space on the mat, or been part of my journey, you know how deeply I care about what I do. And if you’re just getting to know me, I hope you’ll feel the sincerity in my words.
How You Can Help
If you feel called to contribute, know that every donation, no matter the size, helps move this dream forward. Even sharing this campaign with others can make a big difference.
All funds will go directly toward:
· Essential training equipment
· Improving the in-home training space
· Supporting ongoing client care during this transitional phase
If you would like to support the growth of this business, the best way is by sharing and contributing to this campaign. Every donation makes a meaningful impact, and if you're interested in working with me or learning more about what I offer, please visit my website at functionalfitness-nj.com, where you can also sign up for updates, training programs, and more. I am truly grateful for your support, and I can't wait to continue building something powerful together.
Thank you for reading, for believing in small businesses like mine, and for being part of this community.

It gives me a tangible goal — a world without cancer — and a cause worth riding for.
Why 300 miles in October?
For me, biking is about connection. There’s no metal shell around me, and because I move a little slower, I actually get to see the world. I can wave to pedestrians, stop into a neighborhood shop, or just take in the city around me. Cycling grounds me in my community.
This month-long challenge is my way of expanding that connection — showing solidarity with those fighting cancer and linking my rides to an even larger community. It’s about turning my love for cycling into something that matters beyond myself.
How you can help
Every donation fuels research, patient support, and resources for people impacted by cancer. Whether you give $5, $50, or simply share this fundraiser, you’re helping turn these 300 miles into something far greater. Together, we can ride toward a world without cancer.
Give me a reason to ride
What would be immensely helpful is giving me destinations. Invite me out — to a craft fair, an art class, a dance, a cool event in Chicago. Tell me where to go, and I’ll bike there. Your suggestions won’t just make this challenge more fun — they’ll turn every mile into a story, every ride into a connection.",150,20.0,

Hi everyone,
My name is Makayla, and I’m the heart behind Bible Bound Co.— a faith-based small business focused on equipping others with beautiful, intentional tools to grow closer to God. From Bible study kits and prayer journals to Bible journaling supplies and other encouraging faith tools, every product is designed to help people deepen their relationship with Christ in a meaningful, creative way.
This vision has been on my heart for a while, and I truly believe God has called me to create this business. But recently, my family and I purchased a home, and much of our resources are currently tied up in necessary renovations. While this new chapter is a blessing, it’s also made it difficult to financially launch this dream that God has placed so strongly in my spirit.
That’s why I’m stepping out in faith and asking for your help.
Your support will go directly toward:
Producing high-quality Bible study and journaling kits
Purchasing supplies like notebooks, pens, tabs, bookmarks, and devotional materials
Creating a website and storefront
Packaging, shipping, and startup marketing
I want this company to serve as a source of encouragement and spiritual growth for women, teens, and anyone eager to dive deeper into the Word. Every item is made with care, prayer, and the hope that it draws someone closer to Jesus.
If you believe in the power of Scripture and the importance of faith-based tools, I’d be honored to have your support — through donations, prayers, or simply sharing this with others.
Thank you for being part of what God is building through Bible Bound Co.
With love and faith,
Makayla

I have some insanely exciting news… I am opening my own flower shop!!
Most of you already know that I am a florist and extremely passionate about the industry. I became a florist right out of high school and fell in love with floristry immediately. Since then, I’ve moved to Portland and continued my career here, doing so much more than I ever could have imagined when I started. From local family-owned shops to the flower market and then spending the last few years freelancing, helping other talented florists in my area with incredible weddings and events.
I am going on 10 years as a florist, and opening my own shop is a dream I didn’t realize was a possibility for me until now. This decision has been overwhelming and a bit scary, but exciting nonetheless. I’m constantly reminded just how much support and love I have from all of you, which makes this feel all the more possible.
While I do have the funds to get started,
I am preparing for months of running the place by myself and the unexpected costs of starting a new business/being a new business owner
, and wanted to give all of you the ability to help out if you would like!
I do not expect to reach the goal that has been set, so anything helps. I know times are tough, so for anyone who isn’t able to contribute financially, I would really just appreciate some advice, words of encouragement, or just more people to be as excited about this as I am :)
I cannot wait for this next chapter and feel so incredibly grateful for my support system! Thank you for being here",2683,41.0,"Flower, Petal, Yellow, Pink, Floristry"

On June I received the following message from my current landlord: ""I hope you’re well. I’ve decided to make changes to the building to help me keep pace with the rising costs associated with owning it and to address the overall dated condition of it. Unfortunately, this requires that I will not be able to continue to rent the space to you. Alexandra and Bobby (owners Zuzu Petals) will be renovating the first-floor unit and run their wine bar out of it at an increased rent.""
It’s not an easy decision, but one I feel is necessary at this point in time to keep up with rises in insurance costs, taxes, and interest rates. I want to give you ample time to find a new location for your business. Feel free to call or text me to go over that. I’m respectful that you probably need time and I’m willing to work with you on that. I’ve enjoyed having you as a tenant since I purchased the property, and I hope we can move forward collaboratively.
Best,

And just like that, I lost my space that I have renovated for the past 20 years, I cried for 2 days straight. As most of you know, I have curated a space that I love and enjoy working in.
After the longest cry of my life I decided to fight back and go after my new space. The greatest news is that
we have a new home, and I need all the help and support I can get to make this space ready for all of us.  The high cost of this transition is much higher than we thought and it can cause us to lose everything.

Hola Plantiitas fam,
What started as a simple dream—to bring lush, beautiful plants into homes and hearts while supporting and giving back to our community—has grown into much more than we ever imagined. We are incredibly grateful for every person who has supported us along the way.
These past months have been very challenging for many small businesses everywhere, especially with everything happening across our country.
Despite all of these hardships, our passion for plants and community keeps us going. We truly don’t want to close our doors and keep this amazing community growing.
However, we have seen a huge drop in business and our expenses keep growing.
This changarrio is more than just another business; is our community family and friends and we want to continue growing with it with you.
As Latine/Latin@‘s, it’s hard to ask for help and especially when it’s something like this.
But, we have to put our pride aside and ASK FOR YOUR HELP!!
We want to keep our doors open at Plantiitas.
So we are here, asking for your help.
We are not asking for a handout but asking to help us keep this dream alive.
This is how you can help us:
-Come shop with us
-Share our page with fiends and family
-Come to our events and workshops
-Host and event with us
We’ve also set up a GoFund me where you can donate directly to keeping Plantiitas’ doors open if you are able to.

Margie Rose,
Gita Rose.
This is the most vulnerable and most authentic action I have ever taken. I am asking for help out of financial deficient and debt to be able to continue my personal LLC business and my path of Authenticity. As well as demonstrate, as medicine, that it is okay to ask for help. In this I harness the power of community, so I may continue to share of my channeling and services. While transitioning in to two new rewarding jobs! As a yoga teacher and kayak guide.
Any help is so appreciated. This asking of help, for me is ceremony, prayer, in action, so Thank you for even just energetically receiving of this GoFundMe
.
This is Huge for my internal energetic masculine, the artist and accomplisher of our being, he is inflamed and exhausted as a result of our current systems. We all deserve a life of affluence and flow, creating from ways that are nourishing and stainable.
I've been in a financial deficient and debt for years, it flows in, it flows out, I know many of us know this... working month to month and never being able to save or get ahead much.
The kind of brutal irony is that the business I am aiming to relaunch is that of a channeling and spiritual embodiment mentor, that's why I've cringed at asking for help in this way before. Being caught up in the ideas that I need to appear a certain way, fully affluent, on social media for ""people to trust me"" again the brutal irony!
This is a demonstration of safety, of the simple, I Am, regardless of the external circumstances. And in this absolute authenticity, there is deep medicine, medicine for me and perhaps others receiving this, regardless if you feel called to donate. It is okay to ask for help.
It is so relevant to declare and set one's standards! In this exaltation, we release and receive.
We are allowed and Needed to know and declare our value and worth! As we set our individual standards from absolute authenticity, a massive ripple effect is created, empowering others that may choose to be effected by my personal declaration, and adding for aid, in action.
So, to those that have supported me through the years, purchasing my services, thank you!!!! I ask, right now, humbly for your personal help, any denomination of money is so deeply received and seen as prayer in action.
To those that have perhaps watched, enjoyed and been inspired my content on social media this is me humbly asking again, I need your help right now, to continue to keep my content sharing consistent and to continue to refine and relaunch the brand that is Gita Rose and Bella of the Mū. Any denomination of money is so deeply received and seen as prayer in action.
I've been going back and forth for years how much to charge for my services, lowering and raising prices. As I wanted to make myself approachable and affordable while honoring and expanding the knowing of my worth. So, this is perhaps a very sweet opportunity for those of you that have perhaps wanted to book sessions with me and it wasn't in your flow, to support me so I can continue to create obtainable ways to receive the offerings of my body of work.
To my friends and family, you know that my finances have long been a hurdle for me and I really do believe it all stems from the energetic layers of self, that is why I am creating this, why I feel asking for help is so powerful. I am opening.
I've always worked other jobs as well while creating and refining my personal LLC. In the restaurant industry for years, then Zipline adventure tourism. I am in a transition period and need help through this passage. I have recently started teaching yoga again, and have recently started as a local ecology steward and kayak guide in Jenner on the Russian River.
It is very important to me, especially after the passing of my blood sister that I enjoy every day, as much as possible.
Forging a life that is physically embodied, connected to nature, and rewarding. I know, I know, I could have gotten a ""real job"" years ago, but wouldn't be the real me.
To my friends and family, any money help would allow me to fully integrate the transitions my immediate family experienced the last four years or so, and help me be able to be in your lives again!
This is why I have been removed and distant from many of you, navigating debt and financial deficit while, creating and showing up as much I could, left me depleted in many other areas, unable to complete my grieving process so as to have present relationships with my loved ones.
To everyone reading, thank you, truly, for taking in of my honest authentic exposure!
The money will first go to paying down debt, loans and credit cards to return me to level ground, to help pull me up out a hole, before it gets any deeper.... And then to act as a bit of a pillow and buffer while I transition into the new jobs and continue to refine and expand GITA ROSE LLC. I aimed for a number $13,000 (number of transformation) that feels a little high for my current situation, my deficit is not that deep, and yet it feels important for me to play with the symbolism and to continue to step into the value of my worth!
I am also available for sessions and immersive containers if any one would like support and reflections in creating a life of deep authenticity, GitaRose.com - I also have some paintings available for sale. You can reach out to me via social media, or email is to be found on my website to inquire.
Thank you so much for receiving of my simple and profound asking for help. The money is needed and is absolutely nourishing for the parts of me that feel overextended and are begin to teeter towards crisis. I will ask for help, before it gets there.

Now, help us secure a permanent home!
Dear friends,
Hey Doc Clinic isn’t just our clinic, it’s yours.
Together, we turned a dream into a place where over 2,000 patients have been seen, respected, and cared for. We built a space that centers BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ folks while welcoming everyone. We’ve grown from one doctor and one admin to a full team because of you, your donations, your trust, your belief that we deserved and needed to exist.
Now we are taking a huge leap with the next big step: buying a building to root into permanency, and just like before, we can’t do it without you.
Why This Matters
Small, community-rooted clinics like ours get pushed out every day by rent hikes, building sales, and unsafe spaces. Owning this building means we stay put, no one can sell it out from under us, make the rent out of reach, or stop us from growing.
This is more than just buying a building. It is about shedding an area of control that dominant systems have long held through rentals and systems that have historically kept people of color out of these spaces. By owning this space, we ensure that Hey Doc Clinic, and the community it serves, will be here for generations.
More Than a Clinic
The continued growth of Hey Doc Clinic is an ongoing community effort, never just one person’s job.
With a permanent home, we will:
Provide assurance and security for our staff, providers, and patients.
Host workshop programming and support groups that bring people together.
Rent space to mission and vision aligned health and wellness practices.
Turn our walls into a gallery for local artists and donate space for community fundraisers.
Offer retail shelf space to support local makers whose products align with our mission.
This is how we root into permanency, creating a lasting space for healing, connection, and belonging.
How You Can Be Part of It
We’re raising funds for the down payment and move-in essentials:
-Carpet Replacement & Interior Paint $15,000
-ADA Ramp & Front Entry Modification $25,000
-Equipment for practitioners $7500
-AC Replacement (AC Units were stolen during vacancy) $25,000
-Moving Expenses $6500
Let’s Do This Together
Hey Doc has always been a collective effort. Every donation, big or small, is part of protecting what we’ve built together and planting it firmly in the ground for the future.
Portland is what we make it, healthcare is what we make it.
Let’s root Hey Doc Clinic into permanency, together.

It has been a classroom, and safe space for middle school and high school youth of Oakland Unified School District.
After 5 years of operation and impact, The Reef has reached a critical point in its story. While the studio has been able to survive many challenges including a global pandemic, the financial state of the studio has been tremulous for years. Recent changes in ownership and auditing has created an immediate financial and operational strain that is now too great to face without community support.
The Reef is seeking aid from our community in order to continue pouring back into the community.

Brandara Family Farm is on a mission to make fresh, healthy food more accessible—by growing microgreens indoors using alternative farming methods in a GAP-certified facility that feeds communities and inspires the next generation of farmers. We love sharing our knowledge and teaching others that you don’t need acres of land to grow real food—just some lights, love, and a little creativity. With your help, we’re building a facility to expand access to nutrient-dense food and create community jobs.
Meet The Founders:
We are Brandon and Sara Mitchell—urban farmers, educators, and founders of Brandara Family Farm . Part of our mission is to share our love of agriculture, innovation, and community. Our farm partners with dieticians, nutritionists, and local organizations like Augusta Locally Grown which helps families access more ways to purchase fresh whole foods by doubling SNAP benefits. Brandara Family Farm microgreens have been part of programs like Food is Medicine and Nourishing Moms that help our customers access the right resources for nutrition. Selling at local farmer’s markets help us connect with our neighbors and spread the word about the delicious and nutritious world of microgreens.
Our Solution:
We’re building a GAP-certified growing, harvesting, and packing facility that uses modern, indoor growing technology to bring nutrient-dense food to underserved communities and provide fresh sustainably grown microgreens to food pantries, food hubs, and farmer’s markets local and regional grocery stores. Our mission is to reimagine vegetables and farming—making it climate-resilient, space-efficient, and accessible in the suburbs, cities, or anywhere in between. We want to make farming cool again, and show people of all ages and backgrounds that yes, you can grow your own food—and make a difference doing it.
Why We're the Right People for This:
Farming is deeply personal for us because we grew up around farms in Maryland and Pennsylvania, learning to garden from our parents and community. Getting our hands dirty and growing food and herbs has always been like a lifeline for us by empowering us to become more self sufficient. Growing up in the 80's and 90's, we saw first hand how entire generations of future farmers were discouraged from pursuing agriculture as a viable way to make a living. And now as we live and work around Augusta, GA, we see the community impact that living in a food desert and lack of agricultural education can create. That’s why we do this—to give people a fighting chance at better health through food and farming. With years of hands-on growing experience and deep ties to our community, we’re uniquely positioned to lead this work with heart and impact.
Our Goal:
We’re raising $30,000 to fund sustainable land development, equipment purchases, USDA GAP certification, and hire local help. Your donation helps us grow food, create jobs, and inspire the future of farming
$3500 helps us put a down payment on a 2100 square foot steel building
$20,000 helps us purchase a 2100 square foot steel building - paid in full
$30,000 helps us purchase a building, create interior space for GAP compliance, cover the cost of GAP certification, and purchase more supplies like soil, trays, lights, racks, and seeds
Stretch Goal - $50,000 helps us hire a local work force
Our Plans:
GAP Certification Costs – Covering USDA fees and compliance costs.
Land & Building Structures – Creating a safe, climate-controlled space for food production and hands on learning experiences by using ecologically conscious building methods.
Equipment – Investing in tools, supplies, and vehicles to streamline harvesting, packaging, and distribution.
Community Jobs – Hiring local residents to be part of this mission.
How You Can Help:
Contribute to and/or share this campaign. Help us make this a movement and inspire others to reconnect with their land and empower themselves through food sovereignty.
Thank you for believing in what we’re building—literally and figuratively. Let’s grow something amazing together.

Hi everyone,
As many of you know, squash has been a lifelong passion of mine. After nearly 28 years in the sport, I’ve recently launched my own coaching business, TM Squash & Training, where I provide private squash lessons for players of all levels, from complete beginners to competitive athletes. My mission is to create a welcoming environment where everyone can learn, grow, and develop a lifelong love of squash and experience all the benefits it brings.
Launching this business has been exciting, but it also comes with significant startup costs, like LLC registration, liability insurance, equipment, court rentals, and outreach to grow my client base. That’s why I’m reaching out to my friends, family, and community for support.
I’m working to raise $6,500 to cover these expenses and give TM Squash & Training the stability it needs to grow and serve the community. Every contribution, no matter the size, will directly support this dream and help me expand access to squash for players of all ages and abilities.
If you’re able to donate, share this campaign, or simply cheer me on, I’d be deeply grateful. Thank you for believing in me and supporting this next chapter!
With gratitude,
Tessa

I am starting this GoFundMe for a few reasons. First, I would like to change my business to incorporate healing. I have lost my son and daughter this year, and it has completely changed how I view my life and my work. After losing two children so suddenly, I have realized that life is very short. I had wanted to change the mission of my business from beauty to health and well-being for a few years. Now, I realize it is time.
Second, I would like to change the name of my business in my daughter’s honor. She passed very quickly from ovarian cancer. She always wanted to start a business with a name that she had for years. I want to honor her by changing to that name.
And finally, I am struggling financially. Not only from taking time off from grief, but also from the time I took off to care for my daughter before she passed and being with my son when he passed. It all happened too quickly!
My focus has always been to help people look and feel good. To me, skincare is more than just creams and makeup. I have done a lot for my clients, and I want to keep that up. And, I want to incorporate healing as well. My daughter suffered a lot during her process. Her doctors did not want to incorporate any naturopathic therapies. They were just giving her chemotherapy and lots and lots of opioids. So, she was either in extreme pain or drugged up. She only lived a year after she was diagnosed. I believe she did not have to suffer as much as she did.
Things are just not looking good for me at the moment, and I need something good.
I specialize in taking care of people. I want to be able to take the time to really focus on people who need the care I can give them. I do not want to lose my business or my purpose. I would appreciate any help I can get to continue with my goal.

But, as is often the way with small businesses and farming, we haven’t yet been able to generate enough revenue to cover a big, unexpected expense.
This spring, we purchased a used commercial freezer for our goat meat.
Unfortunately, it broke down much sooner than expected.
The good news: thanks to our wonderful customers, we sold everything quickly and didn’t lose any meat.
The hard news: without a freezer, we can’t process more goats—which means our farm is at a standstill.
Repairing the freezer will cost $3,000. A brand-new one would be around $7,000, so for now, we’re choosing the repair route.
If you’ve enjoyed our products or simply want to support local farmers, we’d be so grateful for your help. Every dollar brings us closer to getting back up and running.

My name is Khloé and I’m the founder of Vintage Ink Stationery—a cozy, creative haven for journalers, writers, and lovers of all things paper. Vintage Ink was born from my dream to create a space where community, creativity, and self-expression meet. Think a little bit of nostalgia, a dash of literary charm, and a lot of encouragement for people to slow down, write, and connect with themselves and others.
This space isn’t just about stationery—it’s about belonging. Whether you’re jotting down your dreams in a journal, penning a letter to a friend, or discovering a new creative hobby, Vintage Ink Stationery is designed to be a welcoming corner for inspiration, conversation, and connection.
I’ve found the perfect location where this vision can come to life, but the costs of bringing it to reality are adding up quickly. My goal is to open our first physical shop by spring 2026—one that reflects our values of creativity, inclusion, and community—but I need your help to make it happen. Funds raised will go toward things like store build-out, display fixtures, initial inventory, marketing, and hiring local staff to help run workshops and events.
If you’re able to support, every contribution—big or small—brings this dream closer to reality. And if donating isn’t possible right now, sharing our campaign with friends, family, or fellow stationery lovers goes a long way.

To our friends, fans, neighbors, and community:
Spanish Marie started as a dream in 2013. From day one, we set out to build something different. Local laws were changed to make it possible, we built it by hand, and poured everything into it. Over the years we earned recognitions like Best Brewery in Miami and participated in events all over the country. Spanish Marie was built on grit, imagination, and heart. A place rooted in integrity, creativity, and community.
We built a space for Miami’s beer lovers, creatives, misfits, and families to come together. A home for every event imaginable from trivia nights and DND to drag shows and blood raves in the speakeasy. We can still see the neon silhouette of Vecna engulfed in flames during SOOOUR THINGS and the candle lit skies of Spanish Marie and the Brewer's Carb Stone. We saw strangers become regulars and regulars become family.
This year we were hit by the perfect storm: a struggling industry, a staggering economy, rising costs, unpaid invoices, equipment failures, county pressure, fines, staffing challenges, personal health issues and medical procedures that continue. And on top of it all, our rent nearly doubled. It pushed us past the point where the current setup could survive, even during strong months.
We’re now at a breaking point. But there’s still a small window... a tiny chance to stick around. If we can downsize and focus operations around the brewhouse and speakeasy, we have a shot at keeping Spanish Marie alive in a new form.
Your donation will help cover immediate needs like back rent, utilities, labor, equipment repairs, new equipment, and the transition ahead. Every bit helps. Whether it's five dollars, a share, or just a kind message. If you’ve ever had a beer here, attended an event, or felt part of this beautiful thing we built, please consider helping us keep it going.
I’d like to give a huge thanks to every staff member past and present. To everyone who ever came out, brought a friend, supported a release, or just believed in what we were building, you made this more than a brewery. You made it home.
Now the tough part is we need $100,000 and we know this is a big number, but even a piece of that would help us buy some time to find other resources. Every bit helps.
With love and deep gratitude,

I am the owner and brewer at Buffalo Brewing Company
, a family-owned and operated brewery specializing in lager. We brew historic brands like Simon Pure, Manru Lager, and Bellweiser. Our production brewery is located in the historic Schreiber Brewery in the heart of Buffalo's Polonia District.
On the evening of 7/10,
our glycol chiller was vandalized for its aluminum evaporator, rendering the unit useless for our operation
. Since the vandalism, we can no longer produce product. The glycol jacketed, insulated tanks that contain the beer in process have now lost the ability to regulate temperature, essential to the brewing process.
With the chiller destroyed during the height of the summer season, the busiest part of our year and of course the warmest, we are now hoping for a miracle!
Our insurance policy covers mainly our retail operation, including both properties; however, we struggled to get coverage for our Fillmore operation as portions of the building that are intended to be renovated are in bad shape. I took a chance because I wanted to brew in a historic brewery. I knew all along that this would be an uphill battle but never thought we'd suffer a set back of this magnitude.

My name is Alicia Clayton, and I am in the final stages of becoming a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. This has been a long, humbling journey filled with challenges, growth, and the steady belief that healing is always possible.
My deepest passion is working with kids and supporting their families, as well as helping couples and individuals build healthier relationships, find their voice, and heal from the struggles so many of us carry. Strangely enough, I never thought I would enjoy working with couples—but over time I’ve come to love it, and I now see how rewarding that work can be.
Through a sudden chain of events, I have the chance to open a small therapy practice on short notice—possibly within the next two months. If I can step into this quickly, I’m assured a beginning caseload of clients, which is an incredible opportunity. The financial side, however, is a real challenge. Starting a practice requires covering supervision, liability insurance, an online therapy platform, billing systems, office space, and professional listings so new clients can find me.
My dream is to build a practice that offers therapy on a sliding scale so kids, families, and couples can access support without cost being a barrier. I’ve been sober for over five years, and my life experiences have taught me both humility and, to feel alone, and to rebuild—and I want to create a space where others can do the same.
I’m asking for your help in raising $5,000 to cover the essential startup costs. Your support would not only help me get my practice off the ground but would also ripple outward—supporting every child, parent, couple, and individual I’ll be able to walk alongside in their healing journey.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering helping me make this dream a reality. Your encouragement, belief in me, and kindness mean more than I can say.

I’m working on starting a small business built around something that has changed my life — flow arts.
My dream is to make affordable flow props, starting with handmade sock poi, for anyone who wants to try this amazing art form for themselves. My goal is to spread the joy of flow arts to as many people as possible — anyone willing to pick up a pair of poi and give it a spin!
My vehicle situation is finally resolved, and now I’m focused on keeping life moving forward — literally and creatively! This time, I’m ready to build a side income doing something I love, something I’ve wanted to pursue since 2013.
I plan to open an online store where it won’t cost you an arm and a leg for shipping, and where you can get your starter sock poi quickly — all made right here in the U.S.
Flow arts opened up a whole new world for me. It gave me community, confidence, and color when life felt grey. It’s been my happy place during hard times and my favorite way to express myself when words just don’t cut it. It’s also fantastic exercise — great for cardio, endurance, coordination, and keeping the spirit young and adventurous.

I am originally from a small town in Pennsylvania but have lived in New Orleans for the past 4 years. I have always had a passion for animals and a dream to own my own business. I have over 25 years of experience in both volunteering and fostering for animal rescue and retail.
Over the past several years, cat lounges and cafes have increased in popularity around the world, but New Orleans has been left out, until now.
I feel now is the perfect time to combine my two greatest passions and create a fun, relaxing place for both humans and cats to come together, enjoy each other's company, and help find forever homes for homeless cats.
I'm trying to raise enough funds to get this project off the ground. I'm hoping with a little bit of help from the community, I can create a safe and welcoming space for homeless cats to hang out until they find their forever home.
My plan is to find a space where I can create two separate areas. One space will be the actual cat lounge. In this space, there will be lots of things for cats and humans to do to relax and have fun. I would love to be able to create a space big enough to host private and public events like yoga, painting, and game nights.
The second part of the space will be the area for humans to buy all things cat-related. I have some really fun custom toys and merchandise in the works. There will also be mini snacks and soft drinks available for purchase to take into the lounge.
There is no contribution too small; any money raised through this campaign will go directly toward the construction and furnishing of the cat lounge. The faster I can get to my goals, the faster we are to getting homeless cats off the street.
Lastly, as a thank you to anyone who contributes, if you wish to provide your name, you will receive one free entry into the lounge and a free gift upon opening.

It took two years of renovations to turn that building into the cantina-like shop you walk into today; adding stucco walls, a mosaic-tile floor, and a DIY-assemblage style bar counter incorporating old trolley tracks and glass bottles. Open seven days a week, Bantha creates an inclusive environment, welcoming anyone and everyone who walks in for a cup of tea. The shop also hosts a variety of events, including live bands and DJs, comedy shows, poetry readings, and the occasional karaoke night. Over the years, Bantha Tea Bar has become a staple in the Bloomfield-Garfield community and the wider Pittsburgh region, acting as a third space for people all over the city. As Bantha approaches its ten-year anniversary, we find ourselves in a dangerous position. With the never-ending construction swallowing Penn Avenue and rising tariffs on our stock, Bantha is at risk of closing its doors for good. As the surrounding neighborhoods have seen a strong shift in demographics with many small businesses closing, Garfield is beginning to see a similar trend. With Brett and Jack being in the neighborhood for over 15 years they have been able to withstand a variety of challenges, and become a safe space for locals, immigrants, the LGBTQ community and many more.
Jack, Brett, and all the baristas at Bantha want to continue serving the community for another ten years and beyond, but we need your support to keep going.

This dream was put on hold when I stepped away from my career to care for my mother after her husband was tragically killed by a motorist.

In Molalla the community is very eager and excited to have the doors open -everywhere Chris goes in town, everyone he meets will ask him ""When will your restaurant open?""

Hello friends, neighbors, and pizza lovers,
We’re a small, family-owned restaurant right here in downtown Colorado Springs, and just 8 weeks ago we opened our doors with a dream: to bring families together over incredible pizza and one-of-a-kind dining tables where you can order food, play games, and connect with each other.
We’re one of the first restaurants in the USA to feature these innovative interactive tables. Our mission has always been bigger than pizza — it’s about creating a space where families, kids, and friends can make memories while enjoying great food.
But behind the scenes, our journey has been far more difficult than we ever imagined.
The Challenges We Faced
Like most restaurant owners, we knew opening would come with challenges — and we were prepared for them. But from the very beginning, things went wrong:
Construction took more than twice as long as promised.
Almost half of the brand-new kitchen equipment failed in some way, costing us thousands in unforeseen repairs and replacements.
And worst of all: the software that was supposed to power everything — online ordering, reservations, and our interactive tables — turned into a disaster.
We hired a developer a year ago who promised to deliver a fully functioning system with all the features by opening day. Instead, after paying him $155,000, we were left with something completely broken, unstable, and unusable.
When we opened our doors, the system collapsed almost immediately:
Customers couldn’t order or pay smoothly.
Staff had to scramble with pen and paper just to take orders.
Online ordering, waitlists, reservations, pay at the table, and even our website were completely down.
Within 2 weeks, the whole system crashed and became unusable.
It wasn’t just a scramble — it nearly destroyed us before we even began.
The Sacrifice We Made
To build this dream, we put literally everything we own into this restaurant. Our house, our cars, and all our possessions went into construction, equipment, and custom tables. From the dirt floors of the building to the final details, we are now in for over $1 million — money we don’t have but risked because we believed in this dream.
We planned carefully, setting aside $75–100k for software, which both we and the developer agreed was reasonable. But instead, he drained us for $155k, and now it will take another $50k with our new development team just to fix his broken system.
That unplanned $100,000 overrun wiped out our marketing and operating budget — leaving us completely exposed just weeks after opening.
Where We Are Now
We’ve since hired a new 4-person development team who has stabilized the system so it finally doesn’t crash. After 8 weeks of patching broken code, we’re only now able to roll out the basics — like our website and online ordering — things we should have had on day one.
But without the features we originally promised, we can’t deliver the full experience we dreamed of:
More family-engaging games on the tables (like trivia night).
Build-your-own menu customization.
Pay-at-the-table convenience.
Instead of focusing on food, service, and community, we’ve been fighting fires — and we’re nearly out of money.
Why We’re Asking for Help
We never imagined we’d be in this position. We hate having to ask for help, but after pouring everything we own into this dream, we have no other choice if we want to keep our doors open.
We love what we do — we’ve been making pizzas for over 5 years. We love this community — we’re Colorado Springs natives. And we still believe this restaurant can become something truly special.
The truth is, $50,000 won’t cover all of the software fixes or operating expenses we’re facing — but every bit helps, and it will make a huge dent in getting us back on track:
Helping stabilize and continue developing the software we should have had from day one.
Covering staff and basic operating expenses so we can keep our doors open.
Allowing us to finally invest in small marketing efforts to spread the word.
Every donation — big or small — gets us one step closer to surviving this storm and building the restaurant Colorado Springs deserves
How You Can Help
Come visit us and try a pizza!
Share this campaign with friends, family, and your community.
Leave us a kind review online to help spread the word.
And if you’re able, donate. Every single dollar helps.
We also promise that once we’re stable, we’ll pay it forward by donating back to community and charitable causes here in Colorado Springs.
From Our Family to Yours
❤️
We know times are tough for so many people right now, and it means the world to us that you’ve even taken the time to read our story.
This restaurant is more than just a business — it’s our family’s dream. With your help, we can turn this setback into a comeback and keep serving Colorado Springs the best pizza in the most fun way possible.

I recently moved from Los Angeles, California to Sedona, Arizona at the beginning of this year. I felt called to come here; at first, I didn’t know why. I came here the first week of January for a seminar. Once I was here, I didn’t wanna go back to California, so I stayed, applied for jobs, and found a place to stay.
Since then, I was fortunate enough to land a job and two more after that, then rent a beautiful townhome in the village of Oak Creek. Ten months later, I met this amazing woman who is retiring from her holistic healing business and is willing to offer me the business after she retires.
I see this opportunity as a blessing because I never would have imagined something like this to be possible ten months ago.
With this holistic healing center, I feel I could help so many people, and I’ve always had a feeling that part of my mission and life goal is to help others heal themselves.
I have 3 1/2 months to come up with the down payment, which I’m confident I will be able to make happen.
The amount requested is only a portion of it. The rest I will have myself. Any kind of support would be very well received and appreciated no matter how big or small. Anyone who donates is more than welcome to stop by the healing center for any one therapeutic session free of charge.

Two years ago, we opened Frabjous Catfé with a dream:
To create a cozy, whimsical space in Wake Forest where rescue cats could feel safe and loved—and where people could find joy, healing, and connection.
Thanks to your support, nearly 100 cats found forever homes, and hundreds of people found a sense of peace, purpose, and community here.
But today, that dream is at risk.

Now I Need to Rebuild It for My Body.,https://images.gofundme.com/J2WzpRjEH-cM5jaooFUEgfvMDMw=/128x128/https://www.gofundme.com/person/profiles/60964a8c5d5f46d1adf5a3d9c7e374bd_edited_photo_DFAC4C09-A1A0-41E2-9363-2176E32A9385.jpg,"Hi. I'm Rory Kandel — founder of Rory’s Bakehouse, a frozen bake-at-home bakery built on love, nostalgia, and resilience.
I started Rory’s Bakehouse during lockdown, mostly as a way to stay busy and channel my lifelong love of baking. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was building my childhood dream — a bakery that ships frozen treats nationwide, designed to bring that fresh-from-the-oven magic straight to your home.
On the outside, everything looked like it was rising beautifully. But behind the scenes, my health was starting to crumble. After months of strange symptoms, I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in December 2023. I’m only a year and a half into this diagnosis, but already it has dramatically changed how I move through the world — literally. Walking, something I used to take for granted, has become something I have to focus on with every step.
Still, I show up every day. I love what I do too much to stop. Some people might hang up the apron — and no judgment if they do — but that’s not me. I just need a few accommodations to keep going.
The floors in my kitchen came with the space — I didn’t choose them, and they were never designed with accessibility in mind. Now, every uneven tile feels like a hurdle. I’m still figuring out the right mobility aids, but even without them, just getting from one side of the kitchen to the other can be exhausting, painful, and sometimes even dangerous. What used to be second nature — moving freely, carrying trays, baking with ease — now takes so much more from me.
Replacing the flooring with a smoother, accessible surface and adding a small ramp at the back door would change everything. It would give me the freedom to move safely through the space I’ve poured my heart into — and help ensure I can keep doing what I love for years to come.
This space isn’t just where I work. It’s where I dream, create, and connect with customers who’ve turned into a community. I’ve come this far through grit, cookies, and a whole lot of heart. I’d be so grateful for any support in making this next phase possible.
If we’re lucky enough to exceed our goal, every additional dollar will go toward something even bigger. Any money raised above and beyond what we ask for will be donated to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society — an organization that’s become deeply personal to me since my diagnosis. Your support not only helps me keep baking, but also gives back to a cause that’s working toward better treatment, awareness, and ultimately a cure.
Thank you so much for reading, for caring, and for cheering me on.
With love,
Rory",26274,86.0,"Beauty, Facial expression, Smile, Tooth, Happiness"

Support Parking Lot Owner in Moldova After Arson — 6 Cars Burned
Story:
Dear friends,
On Friday, September 19, 2025, around 4:30 a.m., a tragic incident took place in Moldova. An unknown person doused several cars in a parking lot with a substance and set them on fire. As a result, six cars that had been placed there for sale were completely destroyed.
The parking lot owner now faces the obligation to compensate the full value of these vehicles, with the total damages reaching approximately
$70,000
. For one person, this is an unbearable financial burden that could ruin his livelihood.
We are raising funds to help him recover from this devastating situation.
Every contribution, no matter how small, will make a difference.
All collected donations will be sent directly to Moldova to support the parking lot owner who suffered this loss.
Please consider donating and sharing this campaign. Your generosity will provide real relief in a moment of despair and show that kindness crosses all borders.

First, I want to say how deeply grateful I am. Your encouragement, love and support have carried me to this point where 222 Pastry is truly thriving. What started as a dream is now a busy, growing bakery pop-up that I pour my heart into every single day and I couldn’t have gotten here without you.
Now, I’m stepping into the next chapter. I recently moved into my own beautiful kitchen space, which I share with one other small business. This is an exciting step but it also means I’ve had to purchase all of my own equipment to keep production going.
To truly grow and to keep up with demand I need a few key pieces of equipment:
•	A croissant laminator (to roll butter layers more efficiently)
•	A proofer (to create consistent, high-quality pastries faster)
•	A stacked convection oven
• 30 qt mixer and table
With these tools, I’ll be able to produce so many more croissants and pastries (which you know sell out so quickly!) and my process will become faster and more efficient. This means more of my baked goods will make it into your hands and I’ll be able to expand my wholesale and community offerings.
I know times are tough for everyone and it means so much to me that you’ve already supported me on this journey. If you’re able to contribute or even just share this campaign, you’ll be helping me take 222 Pastry to the next level.
Thank you, truly, for believing in me and in 222 Pastry. Every message, share and donation makes a difference and I’d be honored to have you as part of this next chapter.
With endless thanks and gratitude,
Allie

Your support over the years is the reason we’ve been able to grow and thrive in an ever-changing world.
Unfortunately, this summer has been particularly slow, and I’ve personally been covering the studio’s shortfall. However, I recently experienced a serious medical emergency (a disc herniation), and this has made it difficult for me to continue supporting both my personal expenses and the studio during my recovery.
To help Red Pearl Yoga through this temporary challenge, we’ve created this GoFundMe. Your donation will help us bridge the gap until class attendance naturally increases again usually during the winter season when our snowbirds, travelers, and tourists return to Fort Lauderdale.
If you're able to contribute no matter the amount, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

This mission is deeply personal to me. I, Hannah, along with our dedicated board, founded The Unmentioned Project to honor my dad, whose loss to mental health struggles has been the hardest experience of my life.

website maintenance)
•	Filing fees - ($320 could cover all filing costs)
•	Promotional products - ($90 could cover the cost of stickers with

Aunt Helen would be turning 74 in a couple months. Big Phil might still be meticulously chipping away at a project...
We've all got a cancer story somewhere close to us.
I smoked for 20 years. In March, I decided to try to run some - to try to get in better shape and also ""give back"" a little to my heart and lungs. I know I hadn't taken care of them, and I often worried they'd fail me if I pushed on them too hard.
This summer, I decided to sign up for a 5k race in November, and as I've gotten in my training runs 4 times a week, I've done things I never thought I would. For one, I often wake up at 5:30, lace up my shoes and head out for more than an hour before returning to make breakfast for us, see Rachael off to work and spend the day with Augie.
When this challenge popped up - run 100 miles in October to raise money to support the American Cancer Society, it felt like it fit this moment for me.
100 miles in a month, though... That's more than a 5k every day of the month.
That's a bit of a stretch for training for a 5k! But with a push and your support running for a good cause, I know it's within reach.
So let's do this!
When I hear that alarm in the morning, when I'm out there plodding away in the dark, mile after mile, I'll carry them & your support with me all the way. Thank you.

Her time in the hospital was filled with ups and down, painful moments of struggle, but also beautiful moments of resilience and accomplishments that many thought were impossible. Each day, Mom woke with strength and courage, determined to fight and endure months of challenges with incredible grace.
Clare was so much more than a patient—she was a devoted mother, an accomplished journalist, a cherished friend, a caring nurse of more than thirty years and a beautiful soul who touched every life around her. She loved deeply, laughed often, and gave endlessly. Her radiant smile will never be forgotten.
As we say goodbye, I am carrying forward her story and her spirit telling her story and demanding accountability by creating a documentary with the real life story of her medical journey and building The CCH Foundation (Clare Celano Humanitarian Foundation). The charitable foundation is dedicated to effecting change in healthcare focusing on mental health, patients with disabilities, and accountability within hospitals, subacute facilities, long-term acute care centers, and nursing homes.
No family should ever feel bullied for advocating for their loved one. Doctors must recognize that families often know their loved ones best. Patients deserve access to their own therapists and psychiatrists—especially because trust is not easily given, and for many, it is the foundation of healing.
Our Mission
The mission of the CCH Foundation is to advocate for and support patients by ensuring they have access to the resources, information, and care they need to navigate their healthcare journey.
We are committed to empowering individuals and their families, promoting patient rights, and bridging gaps in healthcare systems.
Through education, support services, and collaboration with healthcare professionals, we strive to create a more compassionate, equitable, and understandable healthcare environment for all patients.
Any contribution, no matter the size, will help us honor Clare’s memory, launch the CCH Foundation, and ensure her fight creates lasting change for others.
Your donations will give us the jump start to file for the 501(c)(3) as well as start creating the documentary of Moms medical journey. No life should end being thrown in a diaper and disrespected. The CCH FOUNDATION promises change.
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your kindness, prayers, and support during this heartbreaking time

We’re Ash and Nico, owners of Beatnix Coffee Station in Dover, New Hampshire. We’ve spent years helping the Seacoast get its coffee fix.
Now we're looking to serve our signature drinks along with exciting new options in a unique social atmosphere: A happening place to hang out and schmooze, without the booze.
Our vision for Beatnix Coffeehaus & Dry Bar is inspired by Beat Generation coffeehouses and temperance bars of the early 20th century. Imagine not only an offbeat spot to grab a coffee, but an evening venue for social events, roundtable discussions, poetry readings, puppet shows… anything our endlessly weird and wonderful community can dream up.
What’s On Tap?
Beatnix Coffeehaus & Dry Bar will offer a diverse assortment of mocktails, non-alcoholic beer and wine, soft drinks, and - of course - Beatnix coffee. Our menu will include:
NA Beer Variety: A quality selection of local and craft non-alcoholic beer.
Creative Mocktails: Signature drinks that match the complexity and flavor of traditional cocktails without the drag on your liver or your wallet.
Coffee: You know it and love it from Beatnix Coffee Station! We’ll continue to feature a selection of hot coffee and cold brew, as well as lattes and espresso-based beverages.
Community Event and Art Space: Featuring regular themed events, live performances, and other gatherings to foster community engagement - not just for hepcats and daddy-o’s, but anyone looking to make connections and get their kicks outside of a conventional bar setting.
Why Non-Alcoholic?
The demand for alcohol-free options is on the rise. Newly-released Gallup polling shows that American alcohol consumption is at its lowest levels in close to a century! For a variety of reasons, people are seeking alternatives, and we want to serve this growing need. We’ll provide a welcoming and inclusive social environment for:
Anyone sober or sober-curious
Anyone looking for a fun night out without the hangover
Anyone looking for a hip, safe, all-ages hangout spot
Funding Goals
We are seeking $150,000 to cover the initial costs of opening, including:
Location Lease: Securing a prime location in historic downtown Dover, NH.
Renovations: Creating a cozy and eclectic atmosphere with comfortable seating, funky bar, lighting, and decor (plus tchotchkes and knick-knacks a-plenty!)
Equipment: Purchasing bar equipment, glassware, and initial inventory.
Marketing: Promoting our initial calendar of events and continuing to build our community presence.
We want to redefine social drinking in the Seacoast region. With your help, we can create an inviting and intriguing space that feels like your favorite local haunt, without the influence of alcohol. Please join us in making Beatnix Coffeehaus & Dry Bar a reality!",4016,45.0,"Graphic design, Graphics"

Since I took over in 2018, it’s been my dream to continue the legacy of this beloved restaurant and keep its doors open for our community. The restaurant isn’t just a place to eat—it’s a gathering spot where memories are made, and where our elderly employees have found a second family.
Right now, we’re facing foreclosure, and without urgent support, we risk losing not just a business, but a vital part of Florence’s history. Lidia’s Cocina has always been about giving back. Every Thanksgiving, we serve meals to those in need, and we maintain a fund to help community members with rent, food, or other essentials. Just recently, we were able to help Shawn Anderson, a local resident facing foreclosure and the threat of losing his home, through our donation fund. At Christmas, we look forward to seeing Nick, our local Santa Claus, who brings joy to the restaurant and the children we sponsor for gifts and school supplies. No one is ever turned away hungry, and our mission has always been to lift up those around us.
I have three employees who have served this community for about 30 years, and they depend on this restaurant for their livelihood. Owning this restaurant was a childhood dream come true for me, and I believe it was a blessing to have the chance to carry on its legacy. With your help, we can protect jobs for our elderly staff, preserve a piece of Florence’s history, and keep serving our neighbors in their times of need. Your support will make a real difference in saving Lidia’s Cocina at Old Pueblo and ensuring it remains a beacon of hope and kindness in our community.",1366,4.0,"Sign, Advertising"

Hi, my name is Julie, and I’m the proud owner of
Julie Baby’s Cupcakes & Dog Treats
—a small business built from love, passion, and the belief that our furry family members deserve the absolute best.
Six years ago, we adopted our sweet rescue pup. Like many new pet parents, I wanted to spoil them with tasty treats—but what I found on store shelves shocked me. Many treats were full of additives and chemicals I couldn’t even pronounce. They didn’t smell right, and I knew deep down I couldn’t feed those to my baby.
So I got to work. After months of research, recipe testing, and inspiration from my own pup, Julie Baby’s Cupcakes & Dog Treats was born. Our treats are made with real, wholesome ingredients—no fillers, no junk, just goodness. If I wouldn’t feed it to my dog, I wouldn’t feed it to yours.
Thanks to an amazing community of dog lovers and customers (many of whom have become friends), we’ve grown slowly and steadily. Every purchase, every like, and every share has helped us continue our mission to create healthy, delicious treats with real benefits for your pets.
Unfortunately, our journey hit a tough spot recently.
Heavy rains severely damaged our supplies, ingredients, and packaging.
We are now facing unexpected costs just to restock and get back to doing what we love.
That’s why I’m reaching out with this fundraiser. We’re asking for a little help to rebuild and replenish what was lost. Your support—whether it’s a donation, a share, or just spreading the word—means the world to us.
Every little bit helps, and every dollar goes directly toward getting us back on our feet so we can continue baking with love for your pups.
From the bottom of my heart (and from my pup Rocky), thank you.
With gratitude,
Julie

This store has been our livelihood since 2011, and we are heartbroken by this loss.
For years, we’ve proudly served the community from our spot in Santee Alley, starting with toys, accessories, and clothes and eventually growing into a full beauty supply store. This business isn’t just a storefront to us it’s how we support our family, pay our bills, and continue our legacy.
The past few months have already been challenging with slower foot traffic, and now this fire has made things even harder. We’ve lost countless products, supplies, and a huge portion of our income. It’s difficult to put into words how much this has impacted us, but please believe us when we say it’s been devastating.
We’re reaching out to ask for your support during this incredibly difficult time. Whether it’s $5, $10, or anything you’re able to give, your donation will go directly toward helping us recover, replace lost inventory, and begin the long journey of rebuilding our store.

Every day we’ve welcomed politicians, pastors, educators, retirees, and families of all walks of life into our dining room — and every single one of you has become more than just guests. You’ve become our friends. We cannot do this without you. You are the most important ingredient in our recipe.
Before opening Season, we wrote a mission statement:
“To be the standard in which our guests compare other dining experiences to.”
That mission has guided every plate we’ve served and every cup of coffee we’ve poured. Our goal is to raise the bar for dining here in Marietta — to create a place where hospitality, quality, and community come together in a way that makes people rethink what a restaurant can be.
We’ve bootstrapped this entire venture from the ground up for the greater good of the community. And while we could never give Marietta back as much as we’ve already received from your love and support, our mission still stands: to build something lasting, something that makes Marietta proud.
Now, as we look forward to new opportunities, we need your help once again. We’ve reached a point where we must take a massive leap forward to meet the growing demand and capitalize on what lies ahead. Every contribution — no matter the size — brings us one step closer to securing the future of Season, supporting our team, and continuing to serve the community that has given us so much.
If Season has made a difference in your life — whether through a meal shared, a coffee flight enjoyed, or just a smile on a tough day — we ask you to consider helping us through this next chapter.
From the bottom of our hearts: thank you for believing in us, for dining with us, and for making Season possible. With your help, the best is yet to come.

Fortunately, no one was hurt, yet the magnitude of the loss for our community and business has been profound.
For over fifty years, Melrose Golf Course has served as a welcoming haven for golfers of all skill levels, families, and friends seeking both relaxation and friendly competition. The business has stood as more than just an enterprise—it represents Tony’s true passion and a source of pride rooted in decades of service to our loyal customers.
The aftermath of the fire has left us facing tremendous challenges: the clubhouse has been entirely destroyed, inventory lost, and plenty of expenses that need to be covered. Without additional support, maintaining the condition of our course, rebuilding facilities, and restoring normal operations will be extremely difficult.
Fundraising Goals
To recover and rebuild, we are seeking financial assistance to address several urgent needs:
· Establishing a temporary clubhouse
· Replacing essential equipment and supplies
· Covering lost income while in this transitional period
Every contribution, regardless of amount, brings us closer to restoring our beloved golf course and continuing to serve the community. If you are unable to donate, sharing our fundraising efforts is equally valuable and deeply appreciated.
We are truly thankful for the outpouring of love and support we have already received. Together, we are confident that we can overcome this hardship and rebuild stronger than ever.

Hey friends, John here.
As many of you know, we had to close this week to deal with some major plumbing issues. And while we avoided the worst case scenario in terms of repair costs, closing and losing a week’s worth of business hit us pretty hard, and to be honest, this couldn’t have come at a worse time.
I opened the Roguelike in the middle of the pandemic, after our original opening date of March 15th, 2020 literally became the day that everything shut down. Since then we’ve weathered an extended closure, multiple strikes that have hit our Burbank friends disproportionately hard, production shutdowns, wildfires, and most recently the devastating effects that the ICE raids have had on the whole city. We’re doing our best and I honestly marvel at the wonderful things that have happened at this bar, but truthfully, we’ve never not been playing catch-up, and this past week puts us even further behind.
As such, I’m asking for your help in creating a Roguelike Tavern “recovery fund” to help us get off our back foot and into a place of strength as we head into the upcoming holiday seasons. I’m hoping to compensate our staff for lost income, pay off the expenses incurred by the repairs & subsequent closure, and accrue an emergency cushion that will allow us to keep our heads above water the next time the unexpected happens, which, honestly, I’m surprised hasn’t happened as I'm typing this.
There has been no greater joy in my life than being a part of the community of customers, collaborators and friends that has coalesced around the Roguelike, and I humbly ask you to help us find our footing again and keep that community alive.

From free meals for those in need, to local events and fundraisers, our mission has always been bigger than just business—it’s about the people, culture, and connections.
But like many small businesses, we’ve been hit hard by rising costs, economic challenges, and the overall price of being in the restaurant industry. Despite our best efforts, we’re now facing the possibility of closing our doors.
We’re not ready to give up—and that’s where you come in.
We’re launching this GoFundMe to raise funds to help us stay open and operate at our highest potential, keep our staff employed, and continue serving the supporters we love and appreciate so dearly. Your support will help cover:

A while ago, my barbershop was shut down due to a tragic police incident that had absolutely nothing to do with me. Unfortunately, the situation forced my doors to close abruptly. Overnight, everything I worked so hard for was gone.
Instead of giving up, I pivoted. My background in music opened unexpected doors, and I was blessed with opportunities to work as a role manager for one of the most iconic groups in the world, through my connection with Eric Sermon. I also had the honor of working with Killer Mike at the famous Swag Shop Barbershop Arena in Edgewood, Atlanta.
I humbled myself and worked everywhere I could — from Walmart barbershops to small neighborhood shops in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and everywhere in between. Every chair I sat behind taught me more about resilience, perseverance, and community.
Now, by the grace of God, the chance to reclaim my shop has come back around. I wasn’t expecting it, I wasn’t prepared for it, but it literally fell in my lap. This is my opportunity to return to my neighborhood, rebuild what I lost, and create something lasting — a safe, positive space where people can come together.
But I can’t do this alone. Reopening requires resources, and financially, I need help to make this blessing possible. That’s why I’m reaching out to my community, friends, and supporters.
Your support — no matter how big or small — will help me reopen this shop and make it more than just a barbershop. It will be a hub for culture, mentorship, and positivity in our neighborhood.

My business idea began while I was a sophomore in college.
I was looking for something to help me apply the things I was learning in my classes. After a couple of failed attempts, I tried making peanut butter and selling it to other students. During this period, another student was trying to raise funds to go overseas. I took the opportunity to help them raise funds through the sales of my peanut butter. While it didn't raise much, I saw the potential that my product had.
I did this for the entirety of the school year, using the concepts from my classes to help build a rough sales model. I took a break the following school year, but quickly realized that I had a product after several people asked about the peanut butter I was selling. So, I started to explore the possibility of turning it into a business. Now, after several years of development,
I believe I am ready to launch. But like any business start-up, I need the funding to begin.

On July 8, our hearts shattered as our barn family suffered an unimaginable loss — eight cherished horses perished in a devastating barn fire at The Mor Linn Farm. Among them were three beloved horses belonging to Samantha Forman and a client of Forman Show Stables, who has been leasing space from the Kennedy family.
While we collectively grieve, we also rally to support Samantha, whose business and heart were deeply impacted by this tragedy. Samantha has been more than just a trainer, she’s been a mentor, a role model, and a source of strength for so many of our children. She’s poured her soul into building a nurturing environment where young riders thrive, and now she needs us to help carry her through this dark chapter.
The fire took the lives of Bear and Prada, two beautiful show ponies who had just begun their promising journeys with our girls, as well as Bowie, another cherished horse. Also lost were all of Samantha’s supplies, tack, and equipment stored in the upper barn.
The road to recovery will be long. Horses are now spread across three different barns, and with no shows or lessons on the horizon, the financial strain is significant. This GoFundMe is being launched to help Samantha rebuild emotionally, logistically, and financially so she can continue the work that has touched so many lives.
We ask you to please keep Samantha and Forman Show Stables in your thoughts and prayers. And if you are able, consider making a donation. Every bit helps ease the burden and ensures that Samantha and her incredible program can rise from this tragedy.
Please share this fundraiser widely. Together, we can show Samantha that the love and support she’s so generously given to others is returned tenfold in her time of need.

A couple of weeks ago, Trevor made the leap of faith to quit his job and just started his own business. Things were finally moving in the right direction, getting everything in order, and he was finally building something of his own.
Then, Friday night, everything changed. His truck was stolen right from his street in Colorado… along with every single tool he owned. His entire livelihood was in that truck, and in one night it was all gone just like that. It still hasn't been found.
After losing his truck and tools, Trevor rented a car and returned home to Iowa to regroup. He picking up what he can from his storage and what he has here, and keep working however possible while he is back. He’s determined to keep pushing forward — because, as he says, “The grind can’t stop.” But he can’t replace everything on his own.
Trevor is almost 9 months sober and has been working every day to rebuild his life and stay strong. What happened could have been the kind of setback that breaks someone, but instead, Trevor is refusing to give up. That kind of strength takes someone who is committed to seeing life in a clearer, better way.
This GoFundMe is to help him get back on my feet — to replace some of the tools he need to keep his business running, to stay moving forward, and to keep proving that no matter what life throws at him, he won’t give up.
Anything you can contribute — whether it’s a donation, sharing this, or even a job lead — would mean the world.
Let’s help Trevor out and show him he is not in this fight alone.
Thanks so much!

It’s been my way of giving back—supporting local artists, helping small businesses stay afloat, raising funds for schools, and creating safe, loud, unforgettable spaces for underground music to thrive. Everything I’ve ever done with Ritual has come straight from the heart. Every dime I’ve made has gone back to the people who needed it more than me—whether that was a band on tour, a struggling venue, or a classroom trying to build a library.
This August, we’re putting together something truly special—a four-city tour across Texas featuring 18 incredible bands. This isn’t a big-money, corporate-run festival. It’s a labor of love, built entirely to celebrate the music, the community, and the artists who pour themselves into every note they play.
But right now, I can’t carry this alone. I’ve already invested thousands to make this happen, but with transportation, lodging, and band payouts still hanging in the balance, the tour is at risk. Without support, I can’t give these artists the shows—and the pay—they deserve, and we could lose one of the most meaningful underground events Texas has seen in years.
If Ritual has ever meant something to you—if you’ve come to a show, seen us fight to keep a local business alive, or just believe that music and community matter—I’m asking you to help me keep this dream alive. Even $5 makes a difference. And if you can’t donate, sharing this link is just as powerful.
This tour is about more than music. It’s about proving that when we come together, we can make something beautiful and loud and unforgettable, even when the odds are stacked against us. I’ve always fought for this community. Now, I’m asking for your help so we can keep building it together.",659,64.0,Graphic design

The laughter of a child is nostalgic because you can hear how boundless their joy for life is. So imagine if you had a gift that could bring forth boundless joy that could build dreams inside the eyes of children while placing hope into the forefront of their minds? What if I told you that this gift is a simple whisper away?
Seeing is always believing. So when thinking that a whisper can change a child; doubt is usually the first response. Then suddenly reverberation from success occurs and children of famous people like DJ Khaled confirms ""Another One"" is successfully in the books. Then the likes of Daymond John of Shark Tank, fame is bearing witness to this ""whisper"" so much that he starts to follow the whisperers social media page. Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore can attest too! Curiosity blooms as people will want to know just who is this whisperer? His name is: Travis Foreman aka The Bike Whisperer
Who is Travis Foreman?
Travis Foreman is a native of Long Island. Travis always had a passion for life whether expressing himself through dancing or competiting on the hardwood as a gifted basketball player. Travis was always spirited and ambitious. Travis becoming a teacher was a no brainer, as he is the kind of influencer parents should want around their children to build confidence in their actions while showing them how to be accountable in their character. Travis creates a legacy inside of the minds of children that they can carry on throughout life that will assist them in achieving whatever they put their minds to. If you want to get to that next level, Travis Foreman is a builder of success.
What Is The Next Level For Travis Foreman?
The next level for Travis Foreman in and of itself is a partnership with a company called INSIDE SUCCESS LEGACY BUILDERS to have his own episode of NEXT LEVEL CEO. Travis will have the opportunity to bring his voice and face to whisper what will allow him to reach a bigger audience. A bigger audience will equal a greater impact on a national level. This would be a ground breaking accomplishment; but much like those helpful whispers Travis Foreman has offered to the children, he now needs your support as well.",2235,20.0,

On the night fierce storms tore through Bemidji, one of our community’s most cherished small businesses — Thunderbird Graphics — was devastated. Lovingly operated since May 1992 and owned since August 2018 by our friend Penny Olson, Thunderbird Graphics has been a creative force in our town for years, providing custom designs, signs, apparel, and unwavering support to schools, local events, and fellow small businesses.  Penny has always shown up for us. Now it’s our turn to show up for her.
The damage to the business was extensive and heartbreaking. As with any disaster, many pieces are still unknown, however, the bills continue to come. As Penny sifts through the wreckage and works to rebuild she is left with the continuing expenses both business and personal.
Without the assistance from those that care, Penny struggles to rebuild or reopen — something she has poured her heart, time, and talent into for years.
This GoFundMe is a way for all of us to rally around Penny — to lift her up when she needs it most. Every dollar raised will go directly toward helping bring Penny move forward after the devastation the storm has caused both personally and professionally.
If you’ve ever worked with Penny, worn a shirt she printed, or seen one of her signs around town, you know the care and pride she puts into everything she does. She’s helped shape the visual identity of our community — let’s help her rebuild her own.
Please consider donating, sharing this page, or sending a message of support. Every gesture, big or small, helps more than you know.
Let’s come together, as we always do, and help Penny rise from this storm.",3706,89.0,"Font, Purple, Graphics, Graphic design"

Over the years, I’ve specialized in editorial, commercial, and social makeup, building a career I’m deeply passionate about. My work is not just my livelihood—it’s my creative outlet and the way I connect with my community.
Yesterday, I experienced a devastating setback. When I went to my garage, I found my car had been broken into. The glove compartment was open, the back seat was a mess, and when I checked the trunk, I realized my entire professional makeup kit and lighting setup had been stolen. Everything was gone—my makeup products, brushes, suitcases, lighting, even my hair kit and the crystal bowls I use for sound healing. Years of investment and hard work disappeared in a moment.
This loss has put my ability to work at immediate risk. I have a two-day production job coming up on Friday, and without my kit, I can’t fulfill my commitments. It’s currently low season for my business in Miami, so funds are tight, and replacing even the basics is a challenge.

Holy Shannoli, a woman-owned, self-funded pop-up in Portland.
Since February 2024, operating only as a pop-up, we've generated over $120,000 in net sales. Portland has spoken—you love us, and we love you right back.
But here's the truth: while I wait on SBA funding, which is now delayed, I'm running out of working capital.
Without bridge support from our community to get us through to the holiday season, I will have to end operations.
After careful consideration and encouragement from many of my peers, it's simply time to ask for help. The truth is I am not ready to throw in the towel—Holy Shannoli has been a bright spot for so many of you, and for me.
Why I'm asking for help now:
To keep showing up for you every week, I need short-term help to cover the essentials:
• Booth fees & permits (so you can keep finding us at markets)
• Ingredients & product (so every cannoli is fresh-filled, always)
• Commissary kitchen fees (to produce safely and consistently)
• Packaging & supplies (to serve and cater well)
• Expanded marketing (so more people can find us)
• Emergency expenses (because surprises happen)
I've worked tirelessly to make Holy Shannoli the success it's proven to be. With an arm up from our community, I can bridge this gap, keep our team working, show up through the holidays, and meet the demand you've created—until SBA funding lands.
How your gift helps immediately:
• Keeps us on the market calendar
• Lets us buy ingredients and packaging in bulk (lower costs, steady supply)
• Preserves momentum going into the holidays (our busiest season)
• Protects a loved local small business built with heart
I'll post updates on where we're serving, and how your support is keeping us going. If donating isn't possible, a share means the world.
From the bottom of my heart—thank you for believing in Holy Shannoli and in me. I can't wait to see what we build together next.
Thank you,

My name is Maria; I am an entrepreneur in the food industry. I started my business 8 years ago. With the help of my family, we started off under a tent with very little equipment. With each event we served our food we earned the ability to buy what equipment we needed one piece at a time.
Over the years we built a name for ourselves in our community. We became well known for our Tamales and our Catering services. After our 5 years under a tent, we earned ourselves trailer that was a fish house that we converted into our food trailer. It's been 3 years now using this for all of our pop ups.
We are now in the tail end of our 8th year in business and have been Blessed with an Amazing Opportunity of opening up our own location!!! It is the perfect size for our Taco Shop aka Taqueria!
We have always worked hard to give our community the very best of our California Style Mexican Food staying true to the flavors we grew up eating from our home state and in our homes as well as staying true to our Mexican culture style of cooking.
Our community has been a God Sent Blessing to our Family and to Our Family Business!! They have blessed us time and time again over the course of our 8 years! They have given kindness, encouragement, shared our story, supported us at our events and put us to work with catering and pop ups!
We now come to that same wonderful community asking for your help and support. We need to raise the funds to complete this opportunity and make it a real true dream come true by getting our doors open so that we can continue to serve our food to all of you on a more frequent basis.
There are a couple pieces of equipment that is still needed as well as some permits and branding essentials to make this place our own.
We believe that having this location it will bring true stability to our family and to our business and we will have achieved what we have been working endlessly for, making all of the hard work and sacrifices so many have put into the success and longevity of our small family owned and family operated Mexican Food Business.
Our family thanks each and every one of you that donated to our last cause and for seeing our family thru all of our ups and downs and hardships and for keeping us alive and thriving!
We hope to give back to our community thru this location by blessing it the way you all have blessed us!
We are so excited to open up OUR DOORS to ALL OF YOU located downtown Fargo, North Dakota in the Old Smiling Moose Location!
Please Help in any form that you can. Share our story as much as possible, Donate whatever is safe for your budget, we highly respect your donation as we know how hard everyone works for their incomes, we do not take it so lightly. You can continue to support our business via attending our pop ups, hire us for your catering needs and come to our store front once the doors are open.

My name is Kimberly, and I’m a mom of four with a big dream and a small 3D printer.
Over the past (5) year(s), I’ve been learning how to design and print functional tools for homesteads, gardens, and pets — things like chicken waterer inserts, garden markers, and custom pet accessories. I recently chose the name The Printed Homestead for my future Etsy shop, where I’ll sell affordable, sustainable, and creative 3D-printed products designed for real families like ours.
Unfortunately, my current printer has reached the end of its life, and I need reliable equipment to turn this dream into a real source of income for my family. I’m hoping to raise $1500 to purchase a new printer and starter filament so I can officially open my Etsy shop and begin fulfilling orders.
Every contribution — no matter the size — helps me get one step closer to launching this business and creating something lasting for my kids to be proud of.
If you can’t donate, simply sharing this page means the world to me. Thank you for believing in small beginnings and for helping me build The Printed Homestead.

for 2 years i have been living out of my backpack, with 3 sets of clothes, hotel hopping and living eating mainly rice and oatmeal. its a conscious choice to live as minimal as I can to have the freedom to be a starving artists
and now I am creating this gofundme, recommended by a friend and maybe I can starve less and as I may from time to time need the extra help.
the past year and a half, starting my music career on my own, doing tik tok lives and posting on instagram on my own has been my dream but also sometimes very hard and maybe soemtiemss lonely.
so I thought to reach out to the community.
i hate having to beg. it makes me feel so out of control and not good enough on my own merit. but then I thought it’s better to reach out to ask for support than starve.
so here I am ❤️
asking for anything to help me keep going and maybe have some more rice and beans to eat later today!

Hi, my name is Dan Stephens, and I’m the founder of Chunkies Cookies — the “Almost World Famous” gourmet cookie brand. After years of perfecting oversized, decadent cookies and building a loyal following online, my family and I are ready to come home to Las Vegas, Nevada — the city where so much of our story began.
Las Vegas is more than just a great location for a cookie shop. It’s where we’ve lived, worked, and dreamed. It’s a place that feels like home, and now we want to plant the roots of Chunkies Cookies here with our very first storefront.
Our goal is to create a one-of-a-kind bakery where locals and visitors can experience:
• Massive, gourmet cookies baked fresh daily with premium ingredients and scratch-made fillings
• A warm, welcoming space that feels like a neighborhood favorite and a Vegas destination
• Community connection, hiring and training local staff and giving back through events and outreach
To make this dream a reality,
we’re raising funds to cover:
• Leasing and building out our Las Vegas storefront
• Commercial baking equipment and custom packaging
• Hiring and training staff
• Launch events to introduce Chunkies Cookies to the Vegas community
Every contribution brings us closer to opening our doors and sharing cookies with the city we’re proud to call home.
If you can’t donate, simply sharing this campaign helps spread the word.
Thank you for helping us bring Chunkies Cookies home to Las Vegas — together, we can make “Almost World Famous” a reality. ✨

Recently, I no longer have my full-time job, which has made it impossible to contribute to the business as I usually do. This sudden change has put SunFlare Brands Company at risk of losing our workspace.

I’ve tried writing this 2x within the past half a year and never posted it. Here I am now ready to ask for a helping hand.

Davids been working way too hard, every single day without a day off for too long bringing income in just for us to be living paycheck to check. We miss him. My children need their father home during the mornings too, plus i can have some of my own mornings to work here from home as well to try and earn income soon. His job requires him to be at work Monday-Friday 9-5, if not more if he works overtime, and he has found many people to do steady side jobs for Friday-Sunday and even after work somedays to make sure we keep moving forward. We currently are living with my mother which has been extremely helpful in figuring out how to start something from nothing but we would love to give her space and have a place of our own too so we can bloom. The reason i am asking for help is because us trying to make a business is exhausting physically, mentally and money wise to start up, we also would love to buy a place of our own for our little family soon so its hard to put something we have spent thousands of hours and dollars on trying to do for everyone off to the side longer. In order to faster progress all the hard work and money that we have put in so far and still are is asking to support my family and i during this journey so we can share with you one day soon what we have been so patiently working on! Every little bit helps and is very much appreciated! Money raised will be used to pay for start up cost like logo and trademark and more, paying off a newly purchased machine and materials, plus any other machines and materials that may be needed to get started.

My career spans multiple facets of the business, including five years as a freelance designer, two years in production, and the balance in wholesale sales.

These steps are crucial to bringing my designs to life and making them available to those who want unique, affordable style. Every contribution will help me move closer to launching the line and reaching customers who are looking for something different and direct from a creator who understands their needs.
This journey has required sacrifice and faith. I’ve invested everything I can into bringing my vision to life, and now I’m inviting my family and friends to be part of the foundation.
Your support will help me reach the final financial goals needed to start up the brand and execute the January show with excellence and precision.

I’m Trinielis Fernandez, the founder of Trinibean Coffee.
Starting my own coffee business has been a lifelong dream, and I finally took that leap of faith and brought Trinibean Coffee to life. As a barista, I take pride in delivering more than just coffee — I strive to provide an exceptional experience with every cup. From the first sip to the last, quality and care are at the heart of everything I do.
Family. Heritage. Quality.
These values are at the heart of everything I do at Trinibean Coffee.
Family and heritage mean the most to me — they’re the foundation of who I am and why I started this business. That’s why I’m committed to investing in and offering authentic, high-quality coffee beans imported directly from Puerto Rico.
By sourcing from Puerto Rican growers, I’m not only honoring my roots, but also supporting small farms and sharing a rich coffee tradition that deserves more recognition. Every cup tells a story — of culture, care, and connection.
This is more than coffee. This is legacy in every sip.
As any small business owner knows, the journey isn’t easy — but with hard work, community support, and a little bit of caffeine, anything is possible!
I recently had my very first pop-up event, and it was an incredible experience. It showed me just how much potential Trinibean has — and how much more I want to grow.
To keep the momentum going and continue hosting pop-ups, building my brand, and eventually opening a permanent location, I need a little help. If you feel led to support this dream and be a part of the Trinibean journey, I’d be incredibly grateful for any donation or support you can give.
Here’s Where Your Support Helps:
I know many people may not realize everything that goes into starting a coffee business from the ground up, so I wanted to share some of the key things I’m working toward — both to get started and to eventually grow and enhance the Trinibean Coffee experience.
Startup Essentials
These are the basic things I need to keep Trinibean up and running at pop-ups and local events:
•	Coffee brewing equipment (espresso machine, grinders, kettles, etc.)
•	Quality coffee beans and ingredients
•	Cups, lids, napkins, and other supplies
•	A branded tent or booth setup for outdoor markets
•	Tables, signage, and display materials
•	Permits and vendor fees
•	Transportation and storage solutions
Growth Goals
With your support, I’d also love to make these upgrades to enhance the customer experience and reach more people:
•	Custom-branded merchandise (cups, shirts, stickers)
•	A mobile coffee cart or trailer for more events
•	A user-friendly website for online ordering and updates
•	Marketing and promotional materials
•	Training and hiring part-time help for events
•	Expanding my menu with new seasonal or specialty drinks
Every donation — big or small — helps bring me one step closer to making this dream a reality.
If you’d like to support Trinibean Coffee, please consider donating, sharing my page, or simply stopping by my next pop-up to say hi and grab a cup. ☕️
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for believing in me and in TriniBean Coffee

Tulip & Thread is its sister program, serving trauma-impacted families—especially parents navigating recovery, loss, or housing instability. It’s also our creative arm: a gentle design studio that crafts affirming resources, signage, and healing spaces that feel sacred, soft, and dignified.
This GoFundMe will help cover our startup costs, including:
• Nonprofit registration and 501(c)(3) filing fees
• Trauma-informed bylaws and onboarding materials for board members and advocates
• Outreach flyers, sanctuary signage, and foundational branding
We’re also exploring healing-centered housing models like tiny homes and ADUs to offer physical refuge alongside emotional support. But to apply for grants and partnerships, we need official nonprofit status.
Every dollar you give helps us build spaces where survivors feel seen, held, and empowered.
Whether it’s having a number to call in times of crises, advocates available to provide resources and referrals, or even something as simple as a tulip mural in a sanctuary hallway or a podcast episode on gentle rage, your support helps us say: You are not alone.

She wanted to provide a sense of community to her little town of Gustine, California. Not only is she a published author, but she’s passionate about books and helping others discover the joy of reading. She went full throttle to open Scrawl, Scribble & Smirch Bookshop in less than 45 days! Any of you who’ve ever started a business can truly sense her passion for what she does. Starting a business is not easy, but adding a small town with no signage off the freeway didn’t help. Marie has been sharing, posting, and handing out flyers, letting everyone know about this amazing bookstore and space. Slowly but surely, people are driving from different parts of California to check out her cute little bookstore. She has had 4 articles and a local TV station feature her in just the first 2 months, which is a testament to her commitment and effort to make her bookstore successful.
She’s running out of funds, simply put, and without help, she won’t be able to keep her doors open for much longer.
She could really use our help to keep her dream alive and to keep this gem open in Gustine, California!

Inspired by Alaska’s raw beauty and the power of nature, we design mobile panoramic saunas that combine health benefits, comfort, and style.
Each sauna is built from premium natural materials, featuring panoramic windows, smart heating, and thoughtful details that create a rejuvenating and unforgettable experience. More than just a product, our saunas help people restore balance, relieve stress, strengthen immunity, and improve sleep — all while connecting with nature.
Right now, we are at a crucial stage. To launch our first production line,
we need to rent a workshop space for 2–3 months and build our first three saunas. The total required is $30,000, which will cover rent, equipment, materials, and initial marketing.
We’ve already tested prototypes, refined the design, created visuals, and gained early interest from restaurants, hotels, glamping sites, and spas. The demand is real — now we need your help to scale.
By contributing, you’ll not only help bring this project to life but also become part of our story. Early supporters will be recognized as founding backers, receive our deepest gratitude, and even get exclusive invitations to experience the sauna during the early stages.
Our vision goes beyond building saunas — we aim to create a wellness experience that inspires healthier living, helps businesses attract more guests, and connects people to the essence of nature, comfort, and design.
Every dollar brings us closer to this goal. Thank you for believing in our mission and supporting a vision that can redefine leisure spaces.

Coastal cuisine, strong cocktails, and conversations that shift perspectives. ✨ Join the movement—donate today and help launch The Grande Tavern Road Tour!
For the past 4 years, I’ve poured my heart into The Grande Tavern—a space I created to unite people from all walks of life over incredible food, authentic conversation, and unforgettable experiences. What started as a one-man project has grown into an inspirational platform highlighting entrepreneurs, creatives, and changemakers who inspire us all.
Now, it’s time to take this vision further. My dream is to hit the road along the Pacific West Coast with a traveling version of The Grande Tavern—bringing EXTICULARRY people together to share meals, stories, and perspectives that can heal divides and spark connection. Imagine a caravan filled with laughter, deep conversation, coastal cuisine, and what I call “Mermaid Juice”—all captured and shared to spread a message of openness, love, and community at a time when the world needs it most.
But I can’t do this alone. Your support will directly fund:
Transportation for the tour
Food and supplies️
Merchandise
Audio & video equipment to share the journey with the world ️
Every dollar makes a difference in bringing this vision to life. If you’ve ever believed in me, my work, or the power of unity through shared experience—this is your chance to make an impact.
✨ Donate today and help transform The Grande Tavern from a table in one city to a movement across the coast. Together, we can turn meals into movements, and conversations into change.
Every single dollar fuels this vision. Here’s how you can help bring The Grande Tavern Road Tour to life:
$5 → Fuels the caravan a few extra miles
$10 → Covers drinks + “Mermaid Juice” for a night of deep conversation
$20 → Buys fresh ingredients for one unforgettable dish
$50 → Helps us capture the magic with better audio & video
$100 → Sponsors a full dinner gathering for our guests
No matter the amount, your support goes directly toward making this movement real. Every dollar = more food, more miles, more connections.
✨ Let’s get this show on the road—literally! Your support fuels every mile, every meal, and every conversation that brings people closer together. Donate today and be part of The Grande Tavern Road Tour!",90,6.0,"Red, Font, Pink, Graphic design, Graphics"

I'm Tommy G, the Hockeytown Hypnotist.
Over the past 20 years, I've helped hundreds and hundreds of people break free from their mental limitations and experience what it means to live free from addiction, depression, anxiety, and fear.
Recently, I've helped to form the
Tom Silver Foundation 501c3 nonprofit
where our mission is to promote mind-body wellness for those overlooked and in need. As the Hypnotherapy Program Director for the organization, I am constantly in search of new ways to achieve far-reaching and highly impactful methods of creating lasting, positive change in others.
This book is designed to extend that mission even beyond those I can work with directly.
By utilizing eye-movement and reading patterns alongside some very specific Ericksonian storytelling and word puzzle techniques, I have developed a way to create hypnotically-charged changes in readers that yield dependable results for (so far) 90% of those who actively engage.
My goal is to have this
Self-Helpnosis workbook published professionally
, not through Amazon Direct, to make it more widely available to those who need the help but cannot otherwise afford hypnotherapy.
Your donation goes directly toward funding the creation and publication of this book and helps free people from their mental prisons.",100,7.0,"Facial hair, Beard, Moustache, Sitting, Chair"

And we have been given the opportunity to become the bar's owners!
WHAT: NYC’s premiere sober bar, Hekate Café & Elixir Lounge, on Avenue B in the East Village, will be changing hands. After four years in business, owner Abby Ehmann is selling her “sober oasis” to the staff.
Headed by Manager Eliott Edge, the space will finally be “sober owned.” As the city’s first successful booze-free bar, Hekate has gone from an oddity to an institution, receiving glowing press from over 50 publications and TV stations, becoming the go-to space for those looking to socialize and celebrate without alcohol. “When we first opened, people didn’t really know what a ‘sober bar’ was,” Ehmann says. “We’ve gone from having to explain what alcohol free spirits are to featuring dozens of craft cocktails created by our staff that everyone truly enjoys.”
WHY: Why the decision to sell the place? Abby explains, “My original vision has been 100% realized, with one exception: my sober friends. I opened Hekate for people I know who, for whatever reason, no longer consume alcohol. Turns out they’d rather drink the 0ABV beers at Lucky.” She adds, “Hekate has attracted an entirely new world of humans, thanks in no small part to the amazingly talented staff and Eliott’s enthusiastic efforts.
SEEING INTO THE FUTURE: Changes are in the works, beginning with adding food to the menu and teaming up with a coffee partner. What won’t be changing is the staff’s dedication to serving the widest selection of alcohol free cocktails in America, with a side of mysticism. “Our staff of tarot readers is available almost every hour we’re open,” says Katherine Maley, aka Huge Witch, and the elixir lounge’s chief wrangler of all prognosticators. And, of course, providing a haven to the sober community.
Eliott tells us, “Hekate has become so well-known because of its community. We have hosted so many regulars, so many first dates, so many parties. Folks have told us, ‘I traveled across the globe to see this place. To try your drinks.’ And have left in awe. In a good way. That is not something you get to say about your job every day. This opportunity, to carry the vision of Hekate — the Goddess of the Crossroads — into the future, is an absolute honor,” Edge tells us. “Only three years ago, at the tail end of being a frightful career drunk, I could never have seen any of this. Hekate helped me stay sober. That sobriety taking the form of creativity is a blessing that I did not expect and better than I could’ve imagined.”

It allowed me to process deep childhood trauma, loss, and pain, and it gave me a way to rebuild myself from the inside out. After more than 23 years as an advanced aesthetician, I realized that true beauty and healing cannot be separated — the skin reflects the health of the soul. This is what inspired me to create a boutique that blends customized, results-driven aesthetics with holistic practices like breathwork and Reiki.
With this grant, I would be able to bring that vision to life. The funding would allow me to create a peaceful sanctuary where clients can feel safe to heal and transform. I would invest in designing a calming space, bringing in state-of-the-art aesthetic equipment, and creating a healing environment with tools like meditation mats, aromatherapy, and sound therapy to support breathwork journeys.
Part of this grant would also go toward offering healing opportunities to those who may not have access to them — teens struggling with anxiety and depression, survivors of stroke and muscle atrophy learning to reconnect with their bodies, and individuals who may not resonate with traditional therapy but are seeking a pathway to self-healing. I want my boutique to be more than a business; I want it to be a place where people come to feel seen, nurtured, and renewed.
Ultimately, this grant would give me the chance to take all of my experience — both personal and professional — and transform it into something that can impact lives in a profound way. My mission is to help others heal from the inside out, pairing the science of advanced aesthetics with the soul work of breathwork and holistic healing.",620,6.0,"Chin, Cheek, Eyebrow, Lips, Forehead"

Hey everyone,
I’m Coach Jairo, and I’m reaching out on behalf of the amazing community we’ve built at 144 Academy. Our gym is more than just a training space—it’s a second home. A place where kids, teens, adults, and families come together to grow, push limits, and support one another.
To make our training environment even better—especially during those hot months—we’re working to install a full A/C system inside the academy. The total cost is $11,000, and while that’s a big number, I know we can reach it together with the help of our community.
This is where I’m asking for your support.
Whether you’re able to donate $5, $50, or simply help spread the word—everything helps and everything is appreciated. You’re not just contributing to a gym—you’re investing in a space that continues to impact lives on and off the mats.
Everyone who trains here is part of the 144 family, and this upgrade is for all of us. If you’ve ever felt the heat after a tough session—you already know this A/C will be a game changer.
Thank you for your time, your generosity, and most of all, for being part of this journey. Let’s keep building something special—together.
With gratitude,

Wicker Woodworks and Humango Toys were also completely devastated.
Burn Money has been a staple of the Portland music scene since 2016. they have recorded hundreds of artists, producing countless albums, songs, and memories. There are not words sufficient to describe the impact these talented artists have had on the Portland community, or what the loss of our studio will mean in the days and weeks to come.
As of right now, insurance claims have been denied due to clerical errors, and will take months, if ever, to see a claim approved. The studio was able to salvage some of their equipment, but many works of art, supplies, and furniture were lost to the fire. The entire building is condemned and Burn Money needs to relocate asap to continue doing what they do best, making and producing music.
We are asking the community for help. With insurance funds out of the picture, we need to raise enough money to cover the cost of relocating the studio, and replacing everything that was lost. Please consider donating whatever you can to help get Burn Money and its staff back on their feet. It will be repaid tenfold in the near future with free events and concerts to thank everyone who so kindly helps out in this trying time.

sincerely,

She called me today with our order and said that we needed to pick up early because she didn’t want her stand to get locked up with our lei still inside. That prompted me to ask what? What’s going on??
This is what she shared and I am now sharing with you on her behalf to try and save her lei stand.. with all the talk about kanaka owned business, keeping Hawaiians in Hawaii and showing Aloha, now is the time for all of us to stand together to help this ‘ohana continue their legacy.. and continue to provide everyone with their beautiful lei.
Gladys’ Lei Stand –
A Hawaiian Legacy of Aloha
My name is Bonnie Kaleikini and I am the fourth-generation owner of Gladys’ Lei Stand, a kanaka owned, ‘ohana-run lei business that traces its roots back to 1941—and even further, to Rachel’s Lei Stand, started by my great-tutu lady over 100 years ago. Lei-making is not just a business for us. It is our legacy. It is our koko — our blood.
As a baby, I slept in a carnation flower box while my tutu lady sold leis at Aloha Tower. From the time I could walk, I followed her everywhere — to schools for graduations, to pageants, fairs, hula competitions — learning to string, to sell, to make change, tie ribbons, and most importantly: to share the meaning of aloha. No lei, no aloha.
This stand has always been a Native Hawaiian, female-owned, family-run business — passed down from mother to daughter, generation after generation. We are proud members of the Lei Sellers Association and Boat Sellers Association, and we remain deeply connected to our community and culture.
This lei stand is our livelihood — but also so much more. It is therapy. It is passion. Stringing lei is a sacred act for me — a way to reconnect, to breathe, to give love in tangible form.
We source our flowers from local farms all across the islands:
Tuberose and awapuhi (ginger) from Waimānalo and Wahiawā
Pakalana, pikake, and baby hibiscus from Waimānalo and Nānākuli
Plumeria (pua melia) from Wai‘anae
Puakenikeni from Pearl City
Kika (cigar flowers) from Pālolo and Kapolei
Hilo maile from Hawai‘i Island
Tongan maile from Tonga
We even source flowers internationally when local options are limited or unaffordable — like carnations from Mexicoand dendrobium orchids from Thailand.
But despite all of this, we are now being squeezed out by development — blocked in by construction, ignored by the state, and surrounded by pressure to make room for higher-end stores. We are being pushed off ceded lands that should be serving Native Hawaiians, not displacing them.
We are the last of the Hawaiian female-owned lei stands in this area. And what’s happening isn’t just a threat to my business — it’s a threat to our culture, our community, and our legacy.
This is my life. This is my family’s legacy. This is our aloha.
And I say again: No lei, no aloha.
Recently we have come under difficult times. I am a single mother, and both my parents have become ill.. I have been trying to manage the stand and care for my children and parents. To add to this, the state is demanding a back payment of fees, that unfortunately I also inherited with our lei stand. The state is refusing to allow us to continue our payment plan to pay off this debt and is threatening to shut us down permanently as of the end of this month if we are unable to come up with the balance of $8900 owed.
We have reached out to CNHA, OHA, and lei poina’ole, just for someone to help, advocate, at least get us more time to make this payment..
We humbly ask for any help you possibly can give to keep our stand open.. any amount, prayers or a share to support our cause is greatly appreciated.

SWE is far more than a student organization, it’s a launchpad for future leaders, innovators, and changemakers.
Through initiatives like the annual WE25 Conference (taking place October 23–25 this year in New Orleans), company tours, professional development workshops, and our mentorship program, we help our members gain access to internships, full-time job offers, and the skills they need to thrive in traditionally male-dominated industries.
Your donation will directly support the following initiatives:
SWE Mentoring Program
: This program provides stipends to peer mentors who empower SWE members to reach their full potential in academics and launch their careers in STEM.
Joni McCauley, EE Class of 2025, shared
: “The SWE mentoring program has opened many doors for me. I’ve had the opportunity to gain valuable advice from upperclassmen STEM majors and to learn about scholarship programs and undergraduate research because of the guidance I received from my mentors.”
WE25 Annual Conference Travel
: Donations help reimburse members for conference expenses, ensuring they can take full advantage of this empowering opportunity. Last year, more than 20 SWE members attended WE24, and over half of them secured internships, co-ops, or full-time positions!
Olivia Renner, MFGE Class of 2024
, said: “Going to the career fair was the best thing I’ve ever done. The internship I obtained makes me excited for my future as an engineer.”
Unfortunately, due to the rollback of
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
initiatives, our chapter has experienced significant funding cuts. These changes threaten the vital programs and opportunities we provide for our members, many of whom are first-generation college students, self-supporting, disabled, or navigating their paths in STEM without a built-in network.
That’s why we are launching this GoFundMe with the following goals:
Total Goal
: $10,000
SWE Mentoring Stipends
: $2,500 (10 Mentors × $250 Stipend)
WE25 Annual Conference Travel Expenses
: $7,500 (25 Members × $300 Travel Allowance)
Your contribution will directly impact the lives of aspiring women engineers, helping us close the gender gap in STEM one student at a time. Together, we can ensure that our members don’t just survive in engineering, they lead in it.
If you would like to donate or learn more about our mission and impact, we would be delighted to connect with you. If you’re unable to give right now, sharing this fundraiser is also an incredible help.

My greatest passions in life are delicious drinks and everything kitsch and camp.
My dream life that I have been planning and working towards for several years, is to open my own drive-through coffee shop built into a vintage Airstream trailer called Camp Ground Coffee, located in the woods of Washington state.
In summer of 2024, I signed a contract with a locally known and recommended camper remodeler and $29,000 was taken as a down payment from me to remodel a 1975 Airstream trailer into my coffee camper dream. In June of this year, the business owner suddenly passed away before starting any work on my camper, leaving me (and many others) high and dry, and deep in the hole.
I’ve reached out again and again and have heard nothing back from anyone directly associated with the business or the owner’s estate. However, there is reliable evidence that the estate may be insolvent and the business bank accounts were empty when the owner passed.
I’ve spoken to attorneys, and unfortunately a lawsuit would certainly cost more than the amount I need returned. It has been three months since the owner’s passing, and to the best of my knowledge no probate has been opened for me to file a claim, although that would not by any means guarantee my refund and the process is also costly. I have even taken the step of opening a Consumer Protections complaint with the Attorney General’s office of Washington state. Considering everything, I may likely never see my money returned to me.
The purpose of the fundraiser is to replace the funds that have been taken from me to help start the business I plan to run for the rest of my life, and to help support any legal costs I will incur while fighting in court to get my money back. My goal is to raise enough for another deposit, find a new contractor and start building my dream life after this terrible setback.
Thank you, I really, really hope to see you all at my coffee camper in the woods some day.

My name is Todd Norris, owner of Truck Norris food truck in St. Louis, MO.
Truck Norris was my dream 8 years ago. We have created one of the best food trucks in St. Louis. We are a homegrown, locally owned, and operated business. We even just opened our very first restaurant with hopes of really building on our dream.
However, we have been hit, no pun intended, with some rough times. Our restaurant is very new and does not have the business we were hoping for yet. Then, yesterday at 9:30 AM, coming off Highway 70 and exiting at Natural Bridge, we were involved in a pretty serious truck wreck. Another vehicle went through a red light, and unfortunately, food trucks can't stop on a dime or maneuver safely in a fast method.
The food truck was horribly damaged.
The truck is what is keeping my small business afloat as we build for the future with the restaurant. Now we have lost that, and I am worried. I hate that I'm having to create this account, but we truly need help.
We have filed our info with insurance, but we have no clue how long this will take to receive anything. From lost wages for our business, our staff, and some medical bills, to hopefully a truck replacement.
I'm afraid with how long insurance can take on a matter this large that it will be forever before I can rebuild.
The time and effort it goes into building a food truck is crazy.
I'm hoping that we can get help. I know times are tough for everyone. But honestly, I don't know if we will make it through this without some help. St. Louis is a city that battles for their own. I hope some can battle for us at this moment.
That truck was my life and dream, and in a matter of a few seconds, it could be gone. Any questions, please feel free to reach out or email us.

Wildlife has always been a source of joy and inspiration in my life. One of my earliest memories is visiting a butterfly exhibit on a kindergarten field trip to the Pacific Science Center. That experience lit a spark in me and just a few years later, after a fourth-grade lesson on Monarch butterflies, I begged my mom to plant milkweed in our yard immediately!
As I grew older, that curiosity only deepened. One day while walking my dog, I noticed a group of striking black-and-white butterflies with long wings. After some research, I learned they were Zebra Longwings. To attract them, I needed to know their host plant and finding it opened up a whole new world for me.
I discovered that the most successful way to bring butterflies into my garden was to plant both host plants (where they lay eggs) and nectar plants (where they feed). The results were magical. The sensitive pea I planted for Sulphur butterflies also brought in bumblebees. Firebush provided nectar for butterflies while its berries fed mockingbirds. My yard transformed into a small sanctuary alive with color, sound, and movement.
That transformation showed me something important: when we plant with intention, we restore connections. What starts in our own backyards can ripple outward, healing ecosystems and bringing people closer to the natural world.
Since then, I’ve been dedicated to sharing my love for wildlife and making native plants more accessible. My dream is to own land where I can:
•	Grow native plants and food forest plants so more people can bring these benefits into their own yards
•	Create jobs for butterfly wranglers, nursery staff, and support roles
•	Free up time to make educational content that teaches people how to restore their own spaces with confidence
•	Build a community resource that supports pollinators, food security, and biodiversity
Right now, I’m running my business out of my parents’ house, and at my current pace it would take me three more years to move forward. Waiting that long feels like forever and turning to investors would mean giving up the values that make this work meaningful.
I already have the knowledge, experience, and community connections for this business to succeed. What I’m missing are the resources to secure land and hire help. That’s where you come in.
Your support would not just help me achieve a dream it would give more people access to the plants, knowledge, and inspiration they need to reconnect with the natural world.
Thank you for believing in me and being part of this journey to restore the land.",2003,24.0,"Cheek, Eyebrow, Smile, Forehead, Skin"

Since 1983, I’ve been handcrafting solid wood boxes and cabinets inspired by the Doctor’s time machine. Not mere replicas, but functional works of art—each one a portal to wonder.
Over the years, I’ve created everything from ring boxes and dice tumblers to wall clocks and cremation urns. Every piece is made with care, patience, and imagination. For me, it’s never just been about woodworking—it’s about crafting something real and lasting that brings joy, nostalgia, and a spark of magic into people’s lives.
After years of building in the hills of South Wales, I’ve returned to the U.S. Starting over has been tough. I’m rebuilding from scratch—tools, materials, workspace, everything. That’s why I’ve launched this fundraiser: to revive www.TARDISCabinets.com as a creative hub and breathe life back into the workshop.
With your support, I can keep making pieces that carry the spirit of the TARDIS forward—objects that remind us that time, memory, and imagination are worth preserving. If you’re able to donate, I’d be deeply grateful. And if not, even sharing this page helps more than you know.
Thank you for reading, for believing, and for helping me keep the magic alive.

MindHeart AI
, a liberatory technology company founded by Dr. Sará King, a neuroscientist and medical anthropologist, and Kierstin Gray, a designer, artist and product/marketing specialist.
We design technology that cares for people by strengthening our humanity, not replacing it.
The Problem
Current AI extracts data, spreads disconnection, and makes inequities worse. Meanwhile, mental health struggles are rising worldwide.
Our Solution
We are creating technology in community, weaving evidence-based science, innovation, and ancestral wisdom so the AI model grows from a place of humanity, care and relationship.
The Mirror of Loving Awareness (MoLA)
is an AI guide that helps people see connections between their thoughts, emotions, and the world around them.
The Library of Loving Awareness (LoLA)
trains the MoLA by sharing practices, stories and tools based on neuroscience, art, and traditions of wisdom from around the world.
Together, they power a unique experience where users can receive personalized support for emotional health and collective healing.
Our Source Proofs
Our work is built on the
Systems Based Awareness Map (SBAM)
, the world’s first map of human awareness developed by Dr. King, which has already reached 750k+ people worldwide. It shows how inner healing strengthens outer healing, which is key to helping people and communities thrive.
What You Can Do
We’re raising $1 Million to build the first public prototype. If one million people give $2, we can make the MoLA real - and move one step closer to a world where collective healing is possible.

Mangum Street Suite 102 Durham, NC — just celebrated its grand opening on June 29th as a beautiful new space for art, coffee, and community in the heart of downtown Durham.
Sadly, in the early morning hours of Tuesday, July 15th, the shop was broken into. The front door was damaged, and money was stolen from the register. Thankfully, no one was present or hurt — for that, we are deeply grateful.
After speaking with insurance, the estimated out of pocket costs related to this burglary comes to $1,000. As you can imagine, that’s a tough hit for any small business — especially one that just opened its doors a few weeks ago.
This GoFundMe was created on behalf of Alivia Moe, the incredible owner behind Vessel Coffee House & Art Cafe, to offer support. Alivia built Vessel Coffee House & Art Cafe to be a safe, creative, and welcoming space for all — and now we have a chance to show up for her and this special place.
If you feel moved to help, here are a few ways to support:
Donate what you can — every bit helps!
Share this campaign with your community.
Stop by the shop to grab a coffee or bring a friend — your presence means the world.
We are better together. Thank you for supporting this local gem and reminding Alivia and the Vessel Coffee House & Art Cafe team that Durham and beyond always has their back. ✨

My name is Sheyenne and I am the owner/operator of a retro coffee shop located just outside of Nashville named Sheyegirl Coffee Co. The shop was created out of my intense love for high-quality coffee, all things vintage, and wanting to make a space where all are welcome to step back in time to forget the crazy world for a spell. We sell vintage clothes, merchandise, coffee, tea, treats, sandwiches, mocktails and adaptogens! We have retro sitting rooms where people can sit back and relax in such as our recreated 1950's kitchen and our 1940's living room. We use our own blends of all organic/all natural coffee roasts. Our lattes are handcrafted and made when ordered using all natural ingredients only... NO PUMP SYRUPS. We basically are baking your latte and you can taste the difference. It also makes things very customizable when you don't want something so sweet. So when you ask for a White Mocha here you get real white chocolate! We have been told that we are the coolest coffee shop and some of the best coffee around.
Our doors opened in the small downtown strip in Ashland City, TN in April 2016. Ever since, we have housed hundreds of intimate concerts, writer's nights, vintage movie nights, live jazz music, paint and sips, game nights, and more! My customers have become family, and this is truly a safe place for all to enjoy, create, work, read, or just grab a cup of high-quality coffee. Through the years, we have gotten through many challenges, including Covid, inflation, and construction/parking challenges. Unfortunately, on June 30th, I received a notice that would rock the community and my world.
My employee got a letter that stated our lease would not be renewed and that we would have to vacate the premises in 60 days.
There was no reason given other than they are going in a different direction. We have to be out by August 31st, and I have looked far and wide for a location that might be more affordable for me to be able to set up without asking for help, but alas, there really isn't anything.
I have been looking for a place since I received the notice, and I am still left with things up in the air. I have decided to put all of the shop's things in a couple of large storage units for the next 2 months and hope to raise some funds to be able to help with a new location.
The location that would be a best fit for us would be in areas that are with a higher monthly rent, but know that with the extra financial help we could make this new location flourish even more than at the location we are having to move from as there were always SO many challenges.
I am hoping that this is the push we needed to bring us to a better situation, and with your help, we CAN do it!
We have created such a community within the shop and have helped to give a stage to so many creators, original music artists, and the like! I would love to continue to be a space for the arts, creators, and the open-minded, open-hearted thinkers to continue to grace. It is so important for spots like this to exist for the community, and I would love to continue to work to make it happen!",5620,56.0,"Eyewear, Glasses, Eyebrow, Vision Care, Lips"

Saturday I was headed to a photo shoot and planned to ride a scooter but on the way I was cut off by a car full of people wearing masks. One guy got out and at gunpoint told me to give him my bag as he searched my pockets.  he took my phone and about $200 in cash and my bag which contained two of my Sony cameras , three lenses and my Apple MacBook pro and  several smaller items I’m still trying to inventory then they drove off.  Im NGL it was one of the scariest situations I’ve ever been in,  But thank god nothing crazier happened. I’m thankful to be alive.
I posted online about what happened and got a lot of love and support from my community and thru all that a lot of people said I should create a gofundme so I figured it could only help, This equipment represents years of saving, countless jobs, and every lesson I've learned in my career, So Now I am posting this in hopes that you can all help me as I try to recoup and rebuild my business.
Why I Need Your Help
Im exploring all the avenues I can but the truth is, replacing $20,000 of specialized equipment is an impossible mountain to climb alone.
I am asking for your support to replace the essential core of my kit so I can get back to doing what I love and providing for myself. Every dollar raised will go directly toward replacing the cameras, lenses, and laptop necessary to book my next jobs.
If you can't donate, I completely understand. Sharing this campaign with your network, your photography groups, or on social media would be an equally monumental help.
Thank you, from the deepest part of my heart, for reading my story and for considering a donation. You all know This equipment represents a Dream I’ve been building for the last 6-7 years. This is how I create my art and support my family and pay my bills. So anything you send is greatly appreciated I couldn’t do this without you all so thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You all know how important my art is to me and I want to be able to continue providing customers and potential customers with the very best. I look forward to the day I can use this new equipment to thank you all by creating beautiful work again.

Dave and Kathy arrived to Israel 30 years ago, believing it was a God appointment. Dave began a contracting and remodeling business and Kathy got her real estate license in Hebrew. Our businesses have prospered and supported us, through our businesses we helped establish many others who came to Israel. October 7th 2023 the war began with missiles falling meters away from our balcony, what was supposed to last weeks has lasted two years. Israel closed access to Arab workers, working life came to a standstill. Dave couldn’t get his usual men and when work came in sporadically in 2024 the permitted workers and costs tripled in price.
Hoping for an alternative in business that could survive local difficulties, Dave took a course in selling on Amazon. He was in the top 1% of the course and was offered a beta course the next level. We had savings that we invested in an online store on Amazon featuring knitting products. It’s called Clararti. We were thrilled the products he researched and purchased sold well and we made 20% over our initial investment. He reinvested into more inventory, profits also had to go to living. Knitting is seasonal and he’d like to expand to household products which are purchased year-round.
With your support, we can strengthen our business with additional inventory so it can carry us through these uncertain times and provide a future not dependent on the Israeli economy. These past four years—two under COVID and two in an ongoing war—we experienced how important it is to have a reliable, adaptable source of livelihood when everything shuts down partially or fully. Dave will keep remodeling when work is available.
Only once in 30 years in Israel did we ask for help, with God’s help we have made it thus far, we ask for your help now. It is crucial this month as we need to purchase the inventory in a lump sum for the Christmas season which was very successful last year.

After a life-threatening accident earlier this year, Sara's road to recovery has been long and challenging. Despite this setback, her determination and passion for cooking remain unwavering.
Sara's dream of owning her own food truck has always been close to her heart.
As someone who has dedicated her life to caring for others, including her ailing parents, Sara embodies kindness and compassion. Now, it's our turn to support her.
I'm launching a fundraising campaign organized in her name to help Sara turn her dream into a reality.
Every donation will go directly towards purchasing her very own food truck, empowering her to share her delicious creations with the community.
Your contribution will bring Sara one step closer to achieving her goal. Let's come together to make a difference in her life and help her build a successful business.

I have worked in the television and movie industry for almost the last 10 years. Before that, I was a union carpenter. The volatility of the industry has made it so I need to search out other avenues of work. In the past, I had thought that driving a truck was out of reach until recently when I was in the gym and I spoke with a truck driver who was from out of state and using the gym in his travels. He explained to me that the hardest part is knowing the mechanics of the truck, which I am very well versed in, being that I have been a tool man in the movie business throughout my career. Fixing equipment and knowing what tools are used to do what is right up my alley. I've always been a good driver and I'm able to pretty much back a trailer through the eye of a needle, so I am going to take the plunge.
I'm able to take an intensified course in my area to help get me certified and then I'm going to need to lease a truck.
That's why I need to do this GoFundMe.
I want a second chance at things and my family has been struggling because of the touch and go of the movie industry in our area.

What started as a Korean immigrant family's dream in 1987 became much more than a convenience store – it's been our gathering place and community cornerstone.
The store was passed down to Christina (or Chris, as regulars call her) from her father, Han, and she continued the family tradition of treating every customer like family. After over 30 years as owner, Chris now faces having to rebuild her and her family's lives from scratch. Han originally purchased Hyde & Pacific Liquor and Grocery Mart and worked at the store until his health began failing, and ever since then, it's been a mother-daughter duo with Chris and her mother, Uni. Han passed away this year. Hyde & Pacific is where generations have shopped, where kids buy candy with allowance money, where neighbors stop in for ingredients to cook at home, for a quick heat-up meal, a pint of ice cream, and a bottle of wine to drink with dinner, and where everyone knows your name.
Now, after 38 years of service, our neighborhood institution is in crisis, and will close at the end of September.
The new property owner gave Chris only 60 days' notice to vacate with no future option for the business. To make matters worse, the new landlord is requiring Chris to continue paying rent even though she's had to resort to severely discounting prices, giving things away for free, and taking significant financial losses — all to meet the deadline. During this devastating time, Chris also lost her father Han, who had devoted decades of his life to building this neighborhood institution alongside his family. With Han gone, Chris and Uni must handle both the practicalities—closing the store and settling his estate—and the deeper challenge of preserving his memory and legacy.
Chris faces mounting costs from liquidating inventory under pressure, funeral expenses, and the emotional weight of losing both her father and her life's work simultaneously. The family that has given so much to our neighborhood needs our help during this incredibly difficult time.
Every donation dollar will go toward:
Rent and utility fees from being asked to leave under duress
Loss of wages and incoming revenue
Inventory liquidation losses
Professional business closure and junk removal costs
Funeral expenses for Chris's father
Helping the family through this transition. Three generations have grown and evolved in this store since 1987, including Chris's 9-year-old daughter.
Chris and her family have been there for us for 37 years. Now it's our turn to be there for them.

I've heavily documented the process of getting the books into the US
on the Kickstarter updates
, and the unfortunate impact the tariffs and shifting enforcement standards have caused on the process. Ultimately, I said I would cover all the tariff related charges and I have - you will get your book without any additional charge.
Some people have asked for a spot to contribute to covering the cost though, so I've opened this, with a target of 50% of the total bill I've paid for the tariff & extra fees.
This is an entire voluntary donation. You will get your books just the same either way.
This is for people that either don't think US businesses should be on the hook for last minute tariff expenses, want to pay their own tariffs, or otherwise want to give me money related to the situation.
I'm going to break down what the costs come from, and then what the cost per unit was (roughly) for people that want more information or want to try to exactly pay their tariff fee.
Tariffs/Duties:
$13,123
US Customs Fees:
$4,224
Additional Processing & Logistics Costs:*
~$8,100
Total Additional Costs for the US Books:
$25,447
*this is almost certainly a low estimate on the line
To clarify, this is on top of all the normal shipping and fulfillment costs. The normal shipping and fulfillment of the books from the printer to your door (for the US and Canada books) will cost ~$67,000 in total (from factory to your door - that includes postage and boxes and all that, but is a lower end estimate since it doesn't account for lost products and other fees). But that was priced into the Kickstarter and you've already paid your share when you paid for shipping. The $25,447 was not priced in, and is effectively going to be what I'm paying out of my 'take home' share of the Kickstarter.
So how does this break down? I've imported to the US...
5685
hard cover books (KCLL + KCCC)
2885
softcover books (Spell Reference Manual, Battle Reference Manual, Crafting Reference Manual, etc)
2084
decks cards (Spell Cards, Battle Cards, etc)
If I adjust for what they cost (with some averaging), that means that per item tariff & fee cost is...
~$4
per hardcover book
~$1.25
per softcover book or deck of cards
So, for example, if you got 2 hardcover books, a softcover book, and a deck cards, you could pay $4 + $4 + $1.25 + $1.25 = $11 to cover 'your' share of the tariff. Of course, this is an extremely optional guideline, since I don't
expect
people to pay anything.
Obviously digital orders have no share of the tariff & fees. The per unit numbers are rounded estimates, since not all products cost the exact same price or manufacturing cost, but you can round the direction you feel comfortable with (if you would like to contribute at all).
I'm not dependent on this GoFundMe to stay in business or run the next Kickstarter, but ultimately I've made a lot less money off this Kickstarter than the amount of work I've put in, in a solid chunk of that is due factors pretty much out of my hands, so I've decided to put this up for folks that want to put their finger on scales to return is slightly more toward sanity.
Thank you,

Dear friends, neighbors, and longtime patrons,
Its with a heavy and broken heart that Sandy and I, her son Bryan, must announce that after 60+ wonderful years flipping pancakes and filling coffee cups on the corner of NE 65th St the Ravenna Varsity Restaurant must close its doors Sunday, August 3rd 2025. New lease negotiations fell through, the landlord rejected any potential buyers we put in front of them in hopes to keep the business you know and love running, so now we’re facing the hard costs of closing down this longstanding family business.
Unfortunately shutting down isn't as easy as turning off the griddle, due to closing costs that range from:
Outstanding debt from pandemic losses, rising food prices, city surcharges.
Supplier contracts & service agreements that carry steep early‑termination fees
Employee severance & final payroll for the staff who kept the coffee hot and the smiles warm
We’re asking for $50,000 to cover the bare‑minimum bills that stand between our family and bankruptcy.
Why This Matters
For six decades our family and staff at Ravenna Varsity has been serving as Seattle’s neighborhood breakfast table — the spot for family meals, first jobs, study‑cram hash browns , and endless coffee cup fillings. You made us more than a diner; you made us a community landmark, and for that we will be forever truly grateful. To us running The Varsity has never been about making big profit or perfecting the ultimate dish, its been about the customers and the connections we've made to you and your families while serving a quality home-style meal. Every person who walks through our doors whether you be a monthly drop in or a daily regular you've all become truly like family and it devastates us to see these connections fall prey to these unforeseen circumstances. We will miss each and everyone of you dearly.
How You Can Help
Donate whatever you can — even $5 helps immensely.
Share this campaign with your friends and family, especially former Seattle locals who miss our famous cinnamon buns.
Tell a Varsity memory here or on any of our socials. We appreciate any and all well wishes and classic stories.
Come in for final hug or hot cup of coffee.
Closing is incredibly bittersweet, but with your help we can finish with tears in our eyes but our heads held high, pay our people, and settle our debts without losing everything our family and crew built.
With gratitude (and syrup on our sleeves),
Sandy, Bryan, the entire Pelkey Family & the Ravenna Varsity Team

My name is Kelsy, and I’m reaching out as the founder of Coastal Coffee Co here in Kent, WA. After spending nearly my entire adult life working in the espresso industry and managing a local cafe for 7 years, I finally took the leap this past year to start my own espresso business. If you’ve seen me at the Kent Farmers Market or one of my pop-ups this summer, you know how much love and passion I put into every cup.
But Coastal Coffee Co is about so much more than coffee. Living and working in Kent, I’ve seen firsthand how divided our community can be—especially when it comes to our homeless neighbors, who are often treated with cruelty and indifference. I dream of creating a true third space in our city: a welcoming, safe, and cozy spot for ALL people to come together, relax, and feel seen—no matter their background or circumstances. I want to use my cafe to support local small businesses, host community events like live music and paint & sips, and help those who are hungry or underprivileged.
Starting this business has already meant investing everything I have—my espresso machine, cart, and almost everything else I found secondhand. I’m currently struggling to keep up with bills, but my real goal now is to GROW Coastal Coffee Co into the warm, inclusive community space that Kent needs so badly.
If you believe in the power of kindness, connection, and great coffee, I would be incredibly grateful for any support you can offer. Your contribution will help me bring this vision to life—helping Kent become a place where everyone feels welcome and cared for.
Thank you so much for reading, sharing, and supporting this dream.
With abundant love,

We’re Dillon Graham and Ahamson Duniani — two student filmmakers from Atlanta, GA, and the Bronx, NY, chasing a dream and pouring our hearts into a new film,
Fever Dream
. We’re really excited about this project, and we’d love to have you along for the ride.
What’s Fever Dream about?
It’s the story of Jackson, who spends what feels like a perfect day with Valentina — a muse who’s the embodiment of love: joy, freedom, and pure magic all wrapped up in one person. But just as the day reaches its climax, a phone call pulls Valentina away, leaving Jackson standing there, stunned and heartbroken.
From that moment on, Jackson’s world starts to unravel. He encounters five women who each embody the stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. The catch? These women aren’t real people. They’re fragments of Jackson’s mind trying to make sense of his pain.
It’s a story about love, loss, and the complicated, messy journey toward healing.

As students, we’re working with a super tight budget.
Your support would help us pay our incredible cast and crew fairly, cover essentials like food, housing, and transportation, and handle costs for equipment, locations, and eventually sharing the film with the world.
Why this story matters to us
We want to capture those fleeting moments of happiness, the ache of losing someone, and what it truly takes to move forward. It’s a story about reflection that we hope will evoke an emotion in our audience and ultimately spark a conversation.
How you can help
If you’re able to chip in, even a little means the world. If not, simply sharing our story with friends or on social media is just as powerful. We’re deeply grateful for any support you can offer.
Thanks so much for taking the time to hear us out and believe in this project. We can’t wait to share Fever Dream with you.",1485,31.0,

Herbal Alchemy is more than a syrup, it’s a memory you can taste.
Like true alchemy, we transform what you already have into something richer, deeper, and more alive. Our small-batch syrups are crafted to alchemize your everyday routine: layering flavors that carry memory, spark the senses, and shift your mood, turning the mundane into a moment that feels transportive.
Years in the making, Herbal Alchemy was born from an artist’s creative practice of blending memory, flavor, and transformation. Each bottle is a blend of art, nature, and craft that has the power to change not only your drink, but your moment—and maybe even your day.
We’re now seeking the support of generous donors and early patrons to bring our first full collection to life. With your help, we’ll share these alchemical creations with the world, one sip at a time.
Born in Chicago and infused with years of artistic and culinary devotion, each small-batch flavor tells a story. Grief and joy, longing and wonder, all steeped into syrups that invite you to slow down and savor.
We are raising $15,000 to bring Herbal Alchemy to full launch — covering testing, packaging, and our first shelf-stable run — and $30,000 to secure permits, re-test our Classic line, expand production, and capture the soul of this story on film for marketing, bringing this our muse, aisling and this dream to life
MEET THE MAKER
Raised in a Charleston, Illinois home steeped in community, our founder learned early that food was ceremony.
He didn’t follow recipes. He followed rhythms:
Garlic blooming in a pan
The comfort of voices weaving together at the table
The way a meal carries flavor and memory from one generation to the next.
Years later, trained in fine art and storytelling, he began weaving myth and memory together. Herbal Alchemy is where it all converges — flavor as feeling, myth as muse, alchemy as everyday routine.
WHO IS AISLING?
Aisling is a dreamwalker from the Celestial Grove. An intuitive presence who whispers memory back to life, guiding the creation of each flavor. Through her story, we remember our own.
WHY NOW?
A vision this intentional can’t be rushed—but it can be nourished.
Herbal Alchemy has been years in the making, carefully crafted to be unlike anything else in a syrup industry dominated by mass-produced sameness. In a landscape where a handful of brands monopolize coffee shops, bars, and store shelves, we’re creating something rare: small-batch syrups infused with artistry, memory, and transformation.
Your gift today will help us:
Complete compliance & safety testing so every bottle meets the highest standards.
Produce our first full collection of alchemical syrups.
Launch a thoughtful, beautifully designed online store to share them with the world.
Capture the soul of Herbal Alchemy on film—sharing the story and the magic through marketing that inspires.
With your support, this dream doesn’t just launch—it lives, breathes, and begins transforming everyday drinks into moments worth remembering.
Every gift makes a difference — whether it’s one time, or as a monthly offering that helps keep these flavors and stories flowing.
JOIN THE MYTH. POUR THE MEMORY.
We craft artisanal syrups rooted in the human experiences and memories that connect us all. Honoring the beauty of memory and the stories evoked through taste, each bottle transforms an everyday drink into a moment rich with feeling, meaning, and connection.
If you’ve ever paused at the taste of something beautifully crafted…
If you believe story belongs at the table…
If you want to help an artist bring a bit of wonder into the everyday…

The loss of my cousin at a young age changed my path from teaching to serving families during their most difficult moments. Over the years, I have worked in funeral homes across Norfolk, Middlesex, Suffolk, Plymouth, and Barnstable counties in Massachusetts, caring for families and helping them honor their loved ones. Funeral service is more than a profession to me—it is a calling and a ministry. I believe in leading, educating, and making a difference in people’s lives, and I am proud to serve my community in this way.
I am now ready to take the next step by purchasing a family-owned, community-centered funeral home in Massachusetts. I want to continue the legacy that the funeral home family has established by providing the same level of compassionate care. The funds raised will be used for the downpayment, legal fees, and essential startup costs needed to secure a loan and begin negotiations. With your support, I will be able to continue a funeral home legacy and serve the community's evolving needs.
My vision is to offer more than just traditional funerals. I will provide a wide range of personalized services, helping families celebrate the lives of their loved ones in ways that are meaningful and comfortable for them. Whether it’s a traditional service at the funeral home or a unique celebration at a venue of their choice, I will guide, advocate, and execute every detail. I also plan to create a teaching funeral home, offering apprenticeships to young professionals who want to enter the field but lack connections.

Midwest Sad: Changing the Service Industry, One Cookie at a Time
The service industry has been broken for a long time—burnout, underpaying staff, toxic kitchens, and a constant cycle of instability for small businesses and workers alike. I’ve spent over a decade in this industry, and I know firsthand how unsustainable it can be. But instead of accepting it, I decided to build something different.
Midwest Sad isn’t just about baking. It’s about proving that queer, women-owned businesses don’t have to fit inside anyone else’s expectations. That we don’t have to shrink ourselves, soften our edges, or play along with a system that wasn’t built for us.
For most of my career, I’ve been harassed, assaulted, and made fun of—told I wasn’t strong enough, smart enough, or capable enough to succeed in this industry. I’m sick of it. Things need to change. And if no one else is going to change them, I will.
Midwest Sad is built on three things:
Sustainability
– No more burnout culture. We focus on long-term success, not just surviving shift to shift.
Ethics
– No toxic kitchen environments. No underpaid, overworked employees. Just people who are valued.
Fun
– Because I refuse to let this industry steal my joy anymore.
Right now, Midwest Sad is growing, but we’re dreaming big. We want to build a community kitchen that provides free rent to food entrepreneurs for six months, helping them launch their own businesses without crushing financial barriers. We want to offer free meals, accept food stamps, and ensure that good food is accessible to everyone—not just those who can afford it.
I’m not here to be what others expect of me. I’m here to be myself, to fight for the next generation of food workers, and to build something that actually matters.
Food should be for everyone. Safe kitchens should be the norm. Queer, women-owned businesses should thrive without compromise.
This is just the beginning.

This beloved Philly mom-and-pop shop, owned by Chef Dan Lee - a veteran and Drexel graduate, and his wife Taylor - has always been more than just a restaurant. Dan and Taylor, who are new parents to a baby girl, have poured their hearts into building a space that brings people together and supports the local community.
Farina Pasta Bar is a true neighborhood staple. Over the years, Dan has partnered with local schools, supported other Black-owned and small-owned businesses, and created a welcoming spot for everyone. The break-in has left the business facing a significant loss of income, especially during the slow summer months when every sale counts. With fall typically being the busiest time of year, this setback comes at a critical moment for the family and the business.
The impact goes beyond the owners—Farina Pasta Bar is also home to a dedicated team of employees, many of whom rely on their jobs as their only source of income. These staff members are an essential part of the Farina family, working hard every day to make it possible to serve the community. Funds raised will help Dan, his family, and the entire team recover from several months of lost sales, allowing them to keep their doors open, pay their employees, and continue serving the neighborhood they love. Your support will make a real difference for a business that has always given back to others.
As the head of marketing for Farina Pasta Bar, being a part of this team has been nothing but an honor to work with Dan & Taylor, alongside watching them become new parents to their baby. I've seen them bend over backwards for the community, and right now they need the same help.

If you can't help financially, then there are no hard feelings. Please spread the word and help us build a sustainable future for this community.
Superchief Gallery has been a vital home for underground art, emerging artists, and street culture in Los Angeles for over a decade.

In a city where independent galleries are rapidly disappearing, Superchief has remained a sanctuary for creativity that doesn’t fit the mainstream mold.
But now,
we are facing closure.

We’re calling on the spirit of community, reciprocity, and collective care to support someone who has poured so much of herself into healing others. Our dear friend, the founder of Herbal Root Organics, is navigating a difficult season and is in need of the same love and support she’s shared so generously over the years.
Not only is she a gifted herbalist and visionary entrepreneur, but she is also a devoted single mother who has taken incredible pride in homeschooling her children while running a business rooted in earth medicine and ancestral wisdom. Through her work with HRO, she’s touched the lives of so many—offering teas, tinctures, classes and remedies that have supported families, wombs, and whole communities with care and intention.
In addition to herbal offerings, classes, and retreats, Herbal Root Organics also serves as a beautiful, nourishing event space for the community — hosting birthday parties, bridal and baby showers, micro weddings, corporate wellness events, and more. Supporting this space means keeping a sacred container alive for celebration, connection, and healing in all its forms.
Right now, she’s in need of support to:
Sustain the shop and keep HRO’s offerings available to the community

Right now, I’m running powerful women’s fitness boot camps out of my tiny garage on the border of Federal Way & NE Tacoma  but my dream is so much bigger.
Hi, I’m Tamira — a mom of three, trainer, and dreamer on a mission. Years ago, I struggled with my own fitness and confidence, but transforming myself inspired me to help others feel unstoppable too. My goal is to create a modern, family-friendly fitness studio right here on the Federal Way & Tacoma border.
Right now, I run my boot camps from my garage, where I can only fit four people at a time. Some of my amazing clients bring their kids, and they play in the backyard while we train. It works for now, but when Washington’s cold and rainy season hits, I know I’ll lose families if we don’t have a safe, warm place for their kids to play while parents work out.
My dream is to build a clean, modern studio where:
• Music is pumping and the energy is electric
* There’s beautiful equipment that delivers real results
•	‍ A kids’ play area keeps families together and happy
• Everyone — moms, dads, kids, and families — walks out feeling confident, strong, and unstoppable
Your donation will help me:
• Secure a bigger, modern studio space
•	️‍♀️ Get professional-grade equipment
• Create a safe kids’ play area
• Complete my Pilates certification
•	‍‍ Build a sustainable, inclusive fitness community
Even $5 or $10 helps so much. And if you can’t donate, sharing this link means the world to me. ❤️

For those that know me well, you may know that this year has been a huge uphill battle for me. Now, I am humbly reaching out because two of the things I rely on most for teaching and creating have both broken recently — my iPad and my favorite violin.
My iPad was water damaged and no longer works, along with my Apple Pencil. I used it every day for teaching violin lessons, drawing (which many of you know I love), making flyers, and editing music. Around a few months ago, my violin, one that I’ve loved and played for years — also broke and now needs repairs before I can use it again.
These tools aren’t just objects to me. They’re how I teach, how I share music/art, and how I stay connected to creativity. Losing them both at once has been really hard.
I know I can’t do this alone. If you’re able to contribute, it will go directly toward replacing my iPad and repairing my violin so I can keep teaching, keep drawing, and keep making music.
Thank you for reading, supporting, and caring about me and my art.

Hello, my name is A’Lyece’, and I’m a master tailor and seamstress based in Little Rock, Arkansas. Sewing has been my passion since I was a little girl—starting at just seven years old. I spent my childhood sewing for dolls, friends, and anyone who would let me practice. I always knew this was the career I was meant for.
In high school, I dreamed of going to college for fashion design and was accepted into a program. Sadly, I couldn’t attend due to a family divorce and financial hardship. Though heartbroken, I didn’t give up. I worked part-time and enrolled in fashion classes at a community college in Minneapolis. I took every course I could afford until finances once again forced me to pause my dreams.
At 17, I moved to Arkansas alone and began honing my craft with the skills I had. A few years later, a fashion school opened nearby, and with the help of family and friends, I was able to take more classes and deepen my knowledge. Over the years, I worked in bridal shops, tailoring boutiques, and even held a management position with a major bridal corporation.
In 2017, I achieved a lifelong goal—I opened my first sewing studio. It was one of the proudest moments of my life. Unfortunately, the pandemic forced me to close, and shortly after, I was diagnosed with health issues. I moved to Philadelphia to heal and regroup. During that time, I rebranded, refined my business model, and focused on bridal tailoring—my true passion.
Despite COVID, brides still needed alterations, and I was honored to be the one they called. My time in Philadelphia taught me how to value my time, price my work appropriately, and create the luxury experience brides truly deserve.
In 2023, my children and I returned to Arkansas. I started promoting myself again, and to my surprise, my client base grew rapidly. In May, I found a beautiful space to sublease in the Argenta area, and word-of-mouth brought in at least two new clients every week.
There’s nothing more rewarding than hearing a bride say, “You saved the day,” and knowing I played a part in her happiest memories. However, bridal tailoring is a seasonal business. Without a financial cushion, the slow seasons can be extremely challenging—and that’s where I find myself now.
Despite having built a five-star reputation in the Little Rock area, and being the only highly rated bridal seamstress locally, I’m at risk of losing my space and closing my doors. This is more than just a job—it’s my purpose, my passion, and my way of serving others.
Your donation will help me:
•	Secure a new lease and stable studio space
•	Sustain operations through the slower bridal season
•	Continue offering exceptional service to brides in Arkansas
Whether it’s $10, $100, or simply sharing this campaign, your support means the world to me. Thank you for believing in my craft, my journey, and the future of my small business.

This RV park will be more than just a stop for travelers. My vision includes offering affordable living options for people who need a safe, long-term place to call home without the high cost of traditional housing.
Your support will help create:
A welcoming, family-friendly RV park
Affordable living spaces for veterans, retirees, and working families
Clean, safe sites with essential utilities and amenities
A community atmosphere that feels like home
As you can imagine, starting a project like this takes a lot of work (and funding). Every dollar raised here will go directly toward:
Securing property and preparing the land
Installing hookups, utilities, and road access
Covering permits, licensing, and startup costs
Building the foundation for a long-term, sustainable business
By contributing, you’re not just supporting a small business — you’re helping build a place that will create jobs, bring travelers into the community, and provide affordable living options for those who need them most.
Whether you donate $5, $50, or simply share this campaign, your support makes a huge difference.
Thank you for believing in me, supporting veteran-owned businesses, and helping turn this vision into reality. One day, I hope to welcome you personally to the park.

Our names are Baylie and Taylor, and we share the same dream: to create a space where stories come alive, mysteries unfold, and our community has a cozy place to gather. As two moms of two, we know the value of safe, welcoming spaces — and we want to bring one to Ogden in the form of a bookstore unlike any other.
The Vision
Hidden Chapter Bookstore will be more than a place to buy books. It will be a warm, welcoming space filled with couches, free WiFi, and shelves lined with both used and new books — with a special love for thrillers and mysteries. Beyond books, it will be a community hub:
• Weekly book clubs & poetry nights
• A safe and cozy space for college students and casual readers alike
• Events that bring people together to celebrate stories, imagination, and connection
Why It Matters
Ogden doesn’t have many bookstores that offer this kind of cozy, community vibe. We want to change that — to give our city a place where anyone can walk in, sit down, and feel at home with a story in their hands.
✨ How You Can Help
Starting a bookstore is a big adventure, and as two moms without savings, we can’t do it alone. Your donation will go directly toward:
• Leasing a location in Ogden
• Stocking shelves with both used & new books
• Creating a welcoming, cozy atmosphere with couches, plants, and warm lighting
• Hosting our very first community events
Even a small donation makes a difference — and if you can’t donate, simply sharing this campaign means the world.
A Special Thank You
Everyone who contributes will forever be part of Hidden Chapter’s story. Donors will have their names added to a special “Founders’ Wall” in the store — so each time you visit, you’ll see your name among the first people who believed in this dream.
Let’s turn the page together and create a new chapter for Ogden — one filled with books, mystery, and community.

I homeschool my 3 children as well, who travel with me to work every single day and rely on me for everything.
Yesterday, the transmission in my only vehicle blew up while we were driving down the road. We bought it less than 2 years ago at the local Ford Dealership. We had it towed to the Ford Dealership for a full diagnosis. We just got the call that they need
$15,000 to fully fix the car.
We don't have that amount of cash on hand and now
I have until Monday to lose my entire company and everything my kids rely on, or try to raise money.
We service over 30 properties and 10 different businesses in Northern VT, and our cleaning services alone bring more than $300,000 quarterly to this area of the country.
Not only that, but we use the vehicle to help others in need with food and other donations to our local food banks, as well as homeschooling 3 children in all different grades.
We are working on getting a working capital loan through small business associations, which proves difficult.
We make enough to survive, but not enough to apply for loans of this nature or amount.
Looking through the other GoFundMe stories and seeing how much people are in need is humbling. We don't expect much and we know our story isn't the most important, but it will benefit the greater Vermont area and help us continue to generate money for the people in the small communities we service.

If you’ve received this link, it means we’re already close :). As many of you know, I’ve been on a journey of building a media business. Recently, I’ve been creating films on YouTube and growing a small but meaningful community. Even more exciting, I’m now working on scoring the soundtrack for a feature-length film! A real one with a production team, actors, director, the whole deal. Honestly, it feels surreal, but also like exactly where I’m supposed to be.
When you’re carving out a path that doesn’t have a set blueprint, you just keep showing up with what you have, trusting that today you’re a little further than yesterday.
That said, I find myself having to deal with extremely large files on a daily basis. I'm talking hundreds of gigabytes of video footage. Simply put, my current laptop (which I am super grateful for and has served me greatly) is no longer able to assist me in this line of work. Thus, my workflow is taking a hit, and in turn, so is my business. That's why I am need of a new laptop.
I am currently working while running my business which has been great to have a predictable source of income, however, living in the most expensive city in the US and having to pay a lot for immigration related expenses doesn't leave me with much. Hopefully that will change in the years to come due to my business -- good things take time! That is why I made this page. That whoever believes in my business and the fun things I get to do, is able to spur me on in this journey.
All in all, I'm grateful to even be fortunate enough to have a problem of this nature, as it definitely is a testament to how much GOD can do when you are faithful with the little.

We were instantly great friends; going out to eat together, studying together, traveling and going to events. In March, the global pandemic started and both of us flew together back to the US. I lived on the east coast, while Ann lived on the west, and we couldn't visit each other during this time, but our friendship still grew strong.
Ann is one of the kindest people I know, and maintaining a long distance friendship has been so wonderful.
In August of 2022, I received a devastating text from Ann that she was in the hospital and that the doctors had found a large tumor on her liver. She ended up staying in the hospital for several weeks before they discharged her. She was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroendocrine Carcinoma at 22 years old.
It was heart wrenching to find out. I thought back on the times we were running up the hills in Granada, or when we were sitting in classes together. It was possible that the whole time I knew her, this evil disease was growing inside her.
Today, Ann has undergone numerous surgeries, multiple rounds of radiation, countless rounds of chemotherapy, and now immunotherapy too. I look at her with an unthinkable level of admiration, she is so strong.  Through all the pain, depression, and complicated questions, she has never changed how kind and friendly she is.
I will never know how I got so lucky had been placed in the same class as Ann back in 2020, but I will forever be grateful that it happened.
In October, I've vowed to run 100 miles, and fundraise for cancer research with ACS. We will not stop fighting until we are without cancer in this world.

✨ A safe, fun, and affordable play space for families in our community
Hello, my name is Shameka Wyatt, a preschool director/VPK teacher and mom and together with my husband Eugene, we are bringing my lifelong dream to life: Ozone Indoor Playground & Party Station in Orlando, Florida!
Our mission is simple but powerful: to create a welcoming, safe, and fun environment where children can play safely, learn through exploration, and celebrate milestones, while parents connect and breathe.
Why We Need Your Help
We’ve already taken huge steps:
•	Filed our LLC and secured our business name.
•	Identified a great location right here in Orlando.
•	Invested our own funds and gathered support from family and friends.
•	Designed a space that will include open play areas, party rooms, and a small snack station.
But to open our doors, we need help covering startup costs like:
•	Facility rent and deposit
•	Light renovations & build-out
•	Furniture (tables, couches, seating)
•	Play equipment & toys
•	Marketing & signage
Our goal is to raise $10,000 through this GoFundMe campaign. This will help us cover those essential startup costs so we can open the doors to Ozone and welcome our community in!
________________________________________
The Impact of Ozone
Ozone will be more than just a playground:
•	It will be a safe, indoor environment for kids to play and parents to relax.
•	A party station for birthdays and celebrations that families can afford.
•	A community hub where children develop social, emotional, and physical skills — through the power of play.
As a preschool director and VPK teacher, I’ve seen firsthand how important play is for young children’s growth. I want to give Orlando families a place where play, joy, and community connection come first.
________________________________________
How You Can Help
•	Donate what you can — every dollar brings us closer to opening day.
•	Share this campaign with friends, family, and neighbors — spreading the word is just as valuable as donating.
•	Every gift matters. If you can’t donate, please share this page with your friends, church, and parent groups.
Donors of $100+ will be recognized on our Founding Families Wall inside Ozone—forever part of our story.

Thank You
Starting a business is never easy, but with your help, we can bring Ozone Indoor Playground & Party Station to life and create a space full of laughter, love, and community spirit.
Thank you for believing in our dream and for helping us build something Orlando families will treasure.
With gratitude,
Shameka & Eugene

Hi everyone,
We are two personal trainers who share a passion for helping kids stay active, healthy, and confident. Earlier this year, we poured our hearts (and savings) into opening
Kids Can Be Kids
, an indoor playground in Fernandina Beach for children ages 1-7. It’s a safe, fun, and monitored space where little ones can run, climb, and play while building coordination and confidence.
We dreamed of creating a place where young children could move their bodies, and just be kids. Since opening, the smiles and excitement we see every day remind us why this place matters so much. We’re honored that
Kids Can Be Kids
was voted one of the Best New Businesses in Fernandina Beach, and this is truly a passion project for us.
But as many small businesses know, the early days are tough. Between start-up costs, rent, equipment and insurance, we’ve hit a financial roadblock that threatens our ability to keep the doors open. We are working tirelessly to grow, spread the word, and serve more families—but right now, we need a little help from our community to keep going.
Your donation will help us keep our doors open to families in Fernandina Beach and continue to create new activities and events for the kids to enjoy.
Every dollar makes a difference. If you can’t give financially, sharing our campaign helps more than you know.
We sincerely thank you for believing in us and supporting a space where kids can truly be kids.

The property manager had
no legal right
to withhold & dispose of our $75,000* worth of inventory (see pics), plus personal items that were in a warehouse of a friend who got locked out/evicted.
Texas Property Code Sec. 54.021. LIEN. A person who leases or rents all or part of a building for nonresidential use has a preference
lien on the property of the tenant or subtenant
in the building for rent. (We were neither).
Texas law is 100% on our side, it is only a matter of time and we need help financially to bridge us until then.
Despite telling us that they would let us get our things even if he got locked out. When I would inquire about when can we get our inventory I would be told they will let me know when a good time is but the PM would never get back to me. They held it for months, knowing we needed it & watched as we fell farther behind. Eventually claiming they were ""disposing"" it all without notice, nearly destroying our small business.
I am open to all types of creative ideas/offers of help you may have to get us through this until things are settled.

""
You shouldn't have stored it in another space where the tenant defaulted because we own the items now""
Property Manager.
- Texas law clearly states that landlords only have the right to tenant's property.
Texas Property Code §54.021 creates a statutory landlord's lien on a
tenant's personal property
in a nonresidential building to secure payment of rent.
Our property is consider
third party personal property
aka
non-tenant property
. The only exceptions are abandonment or if the third party signs over the property. We did neither.
-
By withholding such a large percentage of our inventory serious damage was done to the business. It is only a matter of time before we're right back on track. We just need some temporary help.
The 2 pics with trailers full of boxes is the inventory they ""disposed"" of at waste management according to the workers. There was also a ""dump"" trailer that was filled with what most would think of as traditional garbage. Plus some personal items, unopened mail, business records, etc. were taken during clean out. Our cost was approximately $20,000 - $75,000 plus retail. A significant amount was collectible. (Are you wondering why the product wasn't auctioned off? So are we).
We need to raise funding to
bridge us until
we can
recover damages for lost inventory & interfering with our business.
It will be used to hire an attorney, get storage/U-Haul/help to get the rest of our
inventory out of the unit we rent before that is also lost
&
to prevent eviction from home. We fear more will be lost if we don't remove it quickly. We can still save our business.
Since my girlfriend had a stroke 9 years ago,
this business has been how I paid all the bills.
It was my full time job, my career, my retirement. It’s been my only source of income all these years. With sales of over 2.5 million dollars.
Everything with this business is fixable.
It isn't failing because of mismanagement, the economy or trends. We still have a significant amount of inventory if we can save it.
We had inventory in our friend's office warehouse space across from our own office warehouse space. He was struggling to pay his rent. When I spoke with the property manager, we discussed the possibility of him being locked out of his space. I mentioned that I knew he was hoping to find a way to catch up. We both hoped he would. The property manager was aware I had inventory in the space & we sold it online. My friend was a semi-retired mechanic, our items were clearly distinct. I asked the property manager if I needed to remove my inventory before a potential lockout or if I could retrieve it afterward, as we needed it for sales. Adding we needed access to it we couldn't afford on wait 30 or 60 days.
The PM assured me that if he gets locked out, we could make arrangements for me to retrieve it.
My concern was NEVER about permanently losing the inventory. However, I was worried about having to wait an extended period of time to eventually access inventory. -
She knew the inventory was ours.
That we needed to sell.
Wanted it.
She also knew we were prepared to remove it ASAP beforehand if needed.
- A few weeks later he was locked out, I asked the property manager to set up a time, as we needed our inventory, and the property manager would say, ""I will let you know."" (
In Texas, a commercial landlord has no legal right to permanently keep or seize property belonging to a third party, non tenant property.
) The property manager did say that someone had to be present the entire time to ensure we didn't take anything that didn't belong to us. We discussed how long it would take me, and it would likely be a Saturday. I even suggested that I could set all our inventory right in front of the building and move it from there, instead of loading it up, taking it somewhere, and coming back for more. That way, whoever was supervising wouldn't be ""stuck"" there longer. The property manager never got back to us.
The property manager watched as we fell behind on our rent
. The PM then used it as an excuse to continue to withhold our inventory. After another request to retrieve our inventory the PM would allow us to retrieve our inventory
if we caught up on rent.
The PM also went on to say they could change the locks on the door anytime because we were behind. (Lockout)
As you can see this new condition & the threat of all our inventory being withheld put us in a tough & stressful position. I never agreed to the condition of paying back rent to get inventory but at that point feared argument could lead to immediate lockout.
We came close a couple of times on catching up on the rent but never recovered.
The ""NEW"" condition of catch up on the rent to get our inventory is even legal.
-
However, without providing any notice,
they disposed of over $75,000 worth of our inventory,
(this is a conservative estimate of the value) the withholding of the inventory & now this has caused our small business to collapse. I had been pursuing investors & the huge inventory we had was one of the biggest assets to attract them.
We only knew that they were taking away our inventory because several neighbors let us know.
Most of the property was business related. Some of the property was personal, including collectibles. It also included over
200 pieces of unopened mail -packages
(USPS, Amazon & UPS) as well as old business records and bank statements we had stored.
When I contacted the property manager as they were removing my things, I was told,
We had a deal, catch up on the rent and you could have your things & you shouldn’t have left your stuff in a unit where the tenant defaulted. It’s our property now.
We never made a deal.
See above.
We never would have gotten so far behind if PM didn't withhold our inventory. Both of the reasons she gave for withholding our property are not legal by Texas law. Plus she said before the lockout she would let us retrieve our things if it did happen.
I called the police but they said it was a civil matter. I tried to explained why it was not a civil matter anymore. I explained that I did not have a tenant/landlord relationship with the unit that defaulted. The landlord never had any right to keep non-tenant property, etc. Concluding they (the contractor & worker) are claiming they are taking it to the dump. Something isn't right here. They should at least be trying to sell it to recover back rent? The officer tried to explain to me again that this was a civil case. I told the police officer these people are taking my property and I don't even know who they are. He never even attempted to ask the contractors any questions or request to speak to the property manager.
A significant amount of the property was collectibles, so the total value will be higher than $75,000. Most of the boxes you see on the trailers cost $70 to $250 per box just to give you an idea of how much we paid, how big the loss is. The retail value/lost is considerably more.
The attorney I’ve spoken with is confident we will be compensated — but that will likely take a few months. We urgently need help to bridge the business, etc, until I can get back on track.
My house landlord also owns some commercial properties and is familiar with third-party property laws. She tried speaking to the property manager on the phone but was unsuccessful, as she couldn’t get a word in after the initial few seconds. She did help with getting some things out of our current warehouse, securing storage units, renting a U-Haul, and providing some assistance to move about half of what was left in our warehouse.
We have video of everything provided by neighbors, we have witnesses to our things being stored in there, we have video of the company employees saying it was all going to trash. Even though they were clearly separating it.
I have found many people mix-up laws regarding ""storage units"" with other rental property laws. There is a section of law dedicated to storage units in Texas. Even then the landlord doesn't have the right to keep third party property.
I’ll post more details soon, please share. Today I need to meet with people about selling my washer/dryer and dining room set. God Bless All of Those who read this far.",380,35.0,"Smile, Head, Eyewear, Happiness, Face"

Hello, my name is Micah Simpson, and I am the founder of JUIICED, a home-based juice and wellness business in Detroit, MI.
JUIICED was unexpectedly born from a passion for holistic health, wellness, and community empowerment that people saw in me before I saw it in myself. Our mission is simple but powerful: to build generational health through
educating
the elders,
inspiring
adults, and
introducing
youth to preventive care through natural, plant-based solutions. Basically,
bridging the gap between generations to create a legacy of health and wellness.
Right now, JUIICED offers cold-pressed juices, detox packages, herbal teas, and sea moss gel. We also have some digital wellness products that will be available soon! But this is just the beginning. With your support, I can take the next important steps to scale and position JUIICED for long-term success.
Why I’m Raising $3,500
The funds from this campaign will directly support essential business scaling needs, including:
- Registering JUIICED as an LLC (to establish credibility and protect the business)
- Securing food and beverage liability insurance (to safely serve my community)
- Hiring a legal team (to handle contracts, compliance, and future growth)
- Investing in branding and online presence:
• Professional logo, labels, and social media templates
• Updating and upgrading my Square website
• Professional photos and videos to showcase our products and mission
Why This Matters
This first phase of growth will help JUIICED become more than just a home-based business. It will position us to expand into community partnerships, health workshops, and—eventually—a mobile juice truck serving Detroit with affordable, natural wellness.
Your contribution will help lay the foundation for JUIICED to:
Provide healthier options in underserved communities
Create local jobs in Detroit
Educate families about preventive health across generations

Goal : $2,500
Story : Hi, I’m John Bertucci, a 66-year-old New Orleans native and aspiring writer. For 25 years, I worked in TV, crafting over 1,000 commercials and shows as a producer and AVID editor, starting as a radio announcer at 21 in Port Sulphur. After Hurricane Katrina upended my life, I pivoted to IT, managing networks for three Louisiana casinos for 13 years. Last August, I lost my job, and now, on Social Security.
Living modestly in a Baton Rouge apartment with my wife, Maria, whom I recently married, I’m chasing a dream inspired by reading over 280 books-every Sherlock Holmes mystery by Conan Doyle and 22 thrillers by Michael Crichton.
Over the past decade, I’ve written 12 novels, including , a thriller with 25 stories of Hercules the cat and Squealer the parrot solving crimes in New Orleans’ French Quarter and beyond, hitting Amazon this month with Palmetto Publishing. I’m also looking to promote my latest novel, The Bootlegger’s Cousin, a 116,000 word Sicilian saga of whiskey runners from 1905 to 1992 based on my grandmother’s life and her passionate stories. I’ve poured my heart into these stories, drawing from my New Orleans Sicilian American roots and my love for suspense and big ideas.
Now, I’m headed to the Louisiana Book Festival on November 1, 2025, to share them with 20,000 visitors. I’ve reserved a minibooth and need $1,400 for 100 copies of The Bootlegger’s Cousin to sell, plus $700 for signs, bookmarks, and travel. That’s $2,500-my whole monthly SSI budget.
I've always gone it alone, but now I need your help to make this dream real, reaching out to my family, friends, and fans to make this happen. Your support will bring Hercules, Squealer, and my Sicilian heroes to mystery lovers and locals.
If we raise more than $2,500, I’ll publish The Bootlegger’s Cousin professionally to share its gritty tale worldwide. Every dollar helps me live my dream-thank you!

Inspired by Jeremiah 29:11, my vision is to create a welcoming space that serves purpose as much as it serves coffee. I want to reach underserved communities, offering a place where people feel seen, loved, and supported. By operating from a custom-designed mobile unit, I can bring exceptional hospitality, signature specialty beverages, and grab-and-go breakfast items directly to neighborhoods and local events that need it most. Every menu item is thoughtfully crafted, with delicious and healthy choices, and each drink or treat is named after a Biblical figure, adding a unique and meaningful touch to every order.
The funds raised will help me purchase and build out the mobile unit and equip it with everything needed to serve the community. But this fundraiser is about more than just startup costs. My goal is to use Cafe 29:11 as a platform for mission work, traveling to different areas, building authentic relationships, and supporting efforts to save human trafficked children. I want to create real change, one cup at a time, and help build stronger, more connected communities wherever I go.
With your support, Cafe 29:11 can become a beacon of hope and connection, serving both body and soul. Every contribution brings us closer to making this vision a reality and reaching those who need it most.",215,64.0,"Black hair, Long hair, Happiness, Smile, Jewellery"

I’m heartbroken to share that my car was recently broken into and everything I use for work as a makeup artist was stolen. Thousands of dollars’ worth of makeup, tools, brushes, and hair equipment — all gone in a matter of minutes.
This wasn’t just makeup. It was my entire professional kit that I’ve built up over the years through hard work, long hours, and personal sacrifice. Every product and tool in that kit helped me serve my clients, create beautiful looks, and support myself doing what I love. I am a single mother of 2 kids ,  this loss is devastating. Insurance won’t cover the full cost and without my tools I can’t work. I’m doing my best to stay strong and hopeful but I really need help to rebuild.
I’ve created this GoFundMe in hopes of raising enough to replace what was taken so I can get back to doing what I love, making people feel confident and beautiful.
If you’re able to donate I can’t thank you enough. And even if you can’t give, sharing this link would mean so much to me.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindness and support.

My name is Matthew, and I will be sharing our vision with you!
For several years, my wife, Brittany, and I have cultivated a deep love for Japanese culture. What began as a typical appreciation for Japanese anime blossomed into a lifelong cultural learning experience, encompassing its rich history, diverse traditions, and incredible food. Over the years, our daughter too has come to enjoy most things Japanese with a desire to learn more. We've consistently been a community-focused family, whether volunteering for our local Homeowner's Association and PTA, coaching youth in Odyssey of the Mind, participating in 4-H and youth clubs, or hosting foreign exchange students, my philosophy has always been that ""it takes a village.” I've found immense reward in watching young people's curiosity, creativity, and intelligence develop, and it was with this deep-seated belief that the idea for a youth hub first took root.
During a recent trip to Kameoka, we met with several locals to learn more about the community. We were able to confirm a clear need for additional youth resources, from English teachers to dedicated youth spaces. This trip to Kameoka solidified our resolve to open a business and move there, and it was there that we found what could only be described as the door to the perfect opportunity awaiting us to enter, which brings us to this exciting endeavor: to establish a meaningful commercial space that not only serves a business purpose but also deeply enriches the community we've come to admire so much.
Part 1: The Kameoka Youth Hub & English School – An Affordable Community Haven
We are deeply committed to providing a vital community space within Kameoka. We've observed a significant need for a consistent, safe, and fun environment where young people can gather, learn, and grow outside of school or home, alongside a strong desire for English language education. This hub will be an accessible option for Kameoka's youth, designed to be more than just a place to pass time. You will find a dedicated space for youths to socialize over board games, challenge each other with video games, simply chat with friends, get lost in a book with dedicated reading corners, or utilize quiet, focused study spaces for homework and tutoring. Complementing these recreational and study areas, we will establish an “Eikawa” - English Conversation School. This school will offer affordable, engaging English classes for all ages, from children to adults, taught by native English speakers (Matthew and Brittany, with other qualified instructors potentially in the future). We believe providing an accessible and fun environment for English learning will significantly benefit the community, empowering individuals with crucial language skills for global communication and future opportunities. Our goal is to focus on a lifelong passion for English communication and community, not just passing or cramming for the next exam.
Most homes in Japan are built small and compact with limited spaces for focused studying. Libraries are limited by hours and capacity, further limiting options for students. This hub and English school will foster a strong sense of community by offering much-needed recreational options, dedicated study areas, and essential English language education by providing a crucial alternative. We are thrilled to contribute positively to Kameoka by offering this much-needed, safe, and supportive space.
Part 2: Our Vision for a Storefront.
In order to help support this space, our secondary business will be a storefront. Currently, we are exploring several different opportunities to sell prepackaged snacks and beverages.
The Property
Location was a critical factor in our search. We prioritized a venue easily accessible to students, close to schools and residential areas. The former bakery we found is an exceptional fit, located just a three-minute walk from the Junior High and Elementary Schools on the same street, and only one street away from the High School. Additionally, the main library is a quick six-minute stroll from the site.
This location was previously a bakery that operated for several years before going into bankruptcy in 2022. The owner, well-respected in the community, actively participated in efforts to revitalize this area of Kameoka during the city's H Street Initiative, offering baking classes and other events from the bakery. Unfortunately, the H Street Initiative declined as quickly as it began due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and decreased demand for bakery goods led to the store's closure.
A story and idea alone is not proof that this will work, and while proximity to educational institutions is a significant advantage, assessing pedestrian traffic was also important. Our recent observations confirmed nearly every elementary and junior high school student passes directly by this building!
This property also provides flexibility. With a diverse layout, there are several options to expand and diversify in order to meet the growing needs of the surrounding community. With an attached warehouse, we could include additional resources such as cooking, crafting, or other culturally significant activities and events such as indigo dyeing and bamboo craftsmanship from local business owners.
All the pieces were lining up except the one that brings us to this GoFundMe initiative: cost.
Goal
Our goal is to raise at least $100,000. The property itself is listed at $300,000. This amount does not include any renovations, start-up costs, not to mention the personal expense of our families relocation to Japan. This large price tag for the property is our biggest obstacle to realizing our dream and why we are reaching out to you for help.
This, though, is not us expecting money to appear from all corners of the world. With the old saying of “no risk, no reward”, we are also preparing to take the necessary risks to make this dream come true. We will be uprooting ourselves from our friends and family, life-long careers, and cashing in our chips, to include our house of 10 years and a substantial amount of our personal property, in order to help fund this.
My Promise to You
My grandfather was a great man that instilled the value of being a gentleman and being true to one’s word. He would often tell me, “Matthew, a man is only as good as his word”, and that is something that I built my reputation and my life on. My promise to you is that funds donated to this GoFundMe campaign will only be used for the purpose of purchasing or renting and renovating a property for this business venture. If for whatever reason a property is unobtainable and the business is unable to move forward, funds left in the account will be donated to a reputable charity or charities that will be determined at the time of dissolving.
Additionally, as we go through this adventure, we will provide updates and pictures on progress from purchase to renovation and ultimately grand opening! These will be through the GoFundMe campaign or links provided to the social media accounts created as we progress!
Thank you

As a result, they've had no choice but to lay off their entire team of 7 dedicated employees, many of whom have been with them for years. It's devastating to say goodbye to them, even temporarily.

Stella’s Restaurant & Bar has been part of the heartbeat of Battle Lake and Fergus Falls for years — a place for great food, live music, laughter, and community. We’ve been through a lot: a fire in 2019, the pandemic, and missed relief funding that others received. Each setback left a mark, and we’ve worked hard to adapt, keep people employed, and continue serving our towns.
We are raising funds to cover legitimate, disclosed business needs, including:
Operating expenses (payroll, supplies, utilities)
Debt reduction from the fire and pandemic years
Compliance requirements necessary to operate fully — including resolving the issues that currently prevent us from serving alcohol
Improvements to sustain both locations for the future
Every dollar will go toward keeping Stella’s open, compliant, and ready to serve our community for years to come. This is not about bypassing the law — it’s about meeting it head-on and doing what’s needed to get there.
Your support means we can keep our staff employed, keep our doors open, and preserve a place that has brought so many people together. Whether you give $5 or $500, you’re part of Stella’s story.

My brother Henry was recently in a serious car accident, and while it's hard to even put into words, we are so incredibly lucky and grateful that he is still with us today. The difference between life and death came down to one minute and the absolute will to live.
Over the weekend Henry’s truck crashed and caught fire. Henry’s leg was was pinned in the crash and by the grace of god the window smashed out in the crash and he was able to free his leg and pull himself from his rapidly burning truck. Henry has a long road ahead of him physically, emotionally, and financially.
Henry sustained most of his injuries to his right leg. He suffered a dislocated hip and an acetabular fracture (a break in the socket portion of the hip joint), along with deep cuts and heavy bruising. The pain and recovery ahead are significant, and he’ll need time, support, and physical therapy to heal and regain his mobility.
Most people who know him know how hard he’s worked to build something of his own. He recently started his own small business, HM Home Improvement, and was gaining real momentum doing what he loves.
But as a contractor, his tools are everything — and nearly all of them were in the back of his truck when it burned. Watching that go up in flames wasn’t just devastating emotionally; it also wiped out his ability to work and earn an income.
We're asking for help to get Henry back on his feet. To help replace the tools he lost, cover some of the medical and recovery expenses, and give him a fighting chance to keep building the business and life he’s worked so hard for.

I'm sure some might never imagine me, a 5'1"" woman once stuck at 100 pounds, stepping into the role of personal trainer.
But after being laid off from a stable WFH job in 2024, I'm no stranger to life revealing new paths I didn’t know I’d love.
My fitness story:
I started going to the gym with my mom at 13, but it wasn’t until after my teen years that fitness truly clicked for me. But year after year, finding an affordable gym, or a gym that wasn't always packed and equipment always in use, felt impossible for me to continue being consistent.
Then at the end of 2024, the gym that was
finally
working for me, closed permanently, and my search for a new gym began anew. This search lead me to a gym in Culver City. It was smaller and a little pricey, but I was determined to continue with my health and wellness goals, and then, my goal to become a personal trainer.
My path to personal trainer isn't how most find their way into the field. A week into being a new member at the gym, I was “recruited.” Yes, recruited; from being a member to becoming a coach.
Well, first, becoming a sales rep while I studied and learned, then finally, becoming a coach. But something completely unexpected that has turned into one of the most rewarding chapters of my life.
Coaching has helped me find my voice, discover my leadership skills, and witness firsthand how empowering fitness can be.
Since becoming a coach, I’ve had the privilege of guiding clients to healthier, stronger lives. I’ve seen shy beginners grow in confidence and claim their belonging in the gym. I've seen people who once dreaded P.E. class light up with excitement to try new lifts, discover their own strength, and transform their daily habits.
Working at a gym in Los Angeles has been an incredible experience, and it’s inspired me to expand my reach even further.
Now, I’m ready to bring fitness out of the gym and into my community.
My vision is to host outdoor classes at local parks. I will provide fun, inclusive sessions that give people a welcoming space to move their bodies and build strength, no matter their starting point. No gym needed.
To make that possible, I’m raising funds for the basic equipment I’ll need to launch these classes.
Every contribution — no matter the size — will go directly toward equipment like Ybells, resistance bands, medicine balls, exercise mats, and other essentials that make these workouts accessible, effective, and affordable for everyone.
Your support means so much to me. Whether you’re able to donate or simply share this campaign, you’re helping me create something that’s bigger than myself: a space for people to feel empowered, healthy, and strong.
Thank you for believing in me and for helping me take this next step!
Coach India
P.S. To my LA donors: do let me know if you want to come take a class. As a thank you, come take one on me. Coach India is stern and we don't skip core, so don't say I didn't warn you ;).",660,20.0,Font

For 17 incredible years, Corazon Latino has been a vibrant part of the Austin community, providing a space where culture, dance, and fitness come together. Founded and led by Fanny Gonzalez from Venezuela, our studio has weathered many storms, but the current economic climate is challenging us like never before.

As a small business, we are not alone in facing these hurdles, but the impact has been particularly harsh on women-owned, Latino, and people of color businesses across the USA. It’s time for us to reach out and ask for your support.

Querida Familia de Corazón Latino,
Queremos compartir algunas actualizaciones importantes desde nuestro estudio. Durante 17 años increíbles, Corazón Latino ha sido una parte vibrante de la comunidad de Austin, proporcionando un espacio donde la cultura, el baile y la fitness se unen. Fundado y dirigido por Fanny González, originaria de Venezuela, nuestro estudio ha enfrentado muchas dificultades, pero el clima económico actual nos está presentando desafíos como nunca antes.
En los últimos meses, hemos enfrentado aumentos significativos en el alquiler y problemas en nuestro edificio que están afectando nuestra capacidad para servirles. Como pequeño negocio, no estamos solos en enfrentar estos obstáculos, pero el impacto ha sido particularmente severo para los negocios de mujeres, latinos y personas de color en los Estados Unidos. Es momento de que nos dirijamos a ustedes y pidamos su apoyo.
Para continuar nuestra misión de inspirar y empoderar a las personas a través del poder transformador del baile, necesitamos recaudar $25,000. Estos fondos nos ayudarán a cubrir nuestro alquiler y abordar reparaciones urgentes en nuestro edificio, asegurando que Corazón Latino siga siendo un espacio seguro y acogedor para todos.
Corazón Latino desempeña un papel vital en la difusión y preservación del baile latino, celebrando la rica herencia y tradiciones que hacen que nuestra comunidad sea única. Nuestro equipo dedicado refleja nuestra diversidad, con un 95% de nuestro personal siendo latinas y mujeres. Su arduo trabajo y pasión son cruciales para que Corazón Latino sea un entorno nutritivo para todos.
¿Por qué necesitamos su ayuda?

This year we've hosted over 200 artists, welcomed more than 5,000 guests, and in just the past month, our social media content reached over 200,000 views.
We've achieved an incredible amount of success bootstrapping this project, but that's not sustainable. That's not how you create a future.
We've been offered a beautiful new space in Temescal - a safer, more supportive location with room to grow. I want to do this sustainably this time.
Our Goal: Raise $30k in 1 month
Here’s what that gets us:
• ✅ First and last month’s rent + deposit
• ✅ Moving costs + essential utilities
• ✅ A small cushion for the transition period
Our stretch goal is $50k.
The people of Oakland deserve safe, beautiful third spaces - and every dollar goes to building that together.
If we can't raise the money (or get close to that number), we're going to take the next year off.
Why are we moving?
couchdate’s current location is owned by the City of Oakland. On May 6th, while I was unloading groceries into the space,
a shooting
happened right in front of our doors. A bullet ricocheted off my car. Thankfully, none of our team was hurt — but two others were injured.
We reached out for help. The City did nothing. Instead, that same month,
they raised our rent
and fined us for hosting an artist showcase.
We love Oakland. We want to stay in Oakland. We’ve had offers from other cities — Richmond, Sacramento, even San Francisco —
but this Temescal location is our chance to continue serving our home - Oakland.
Our mission has always been to provide Oakland with safe, beautiful, culturally affirming third spaces. Intimate spaces where artists can shine and people can connect.
If you’ve ever met a friend at couchdate, performed here, laughed here, or just felt seen here —
we’re asking you to invest in the future of this community.
Thank you for believing in us, showing up, and keeping couchdate alive all these years. We're looking forward to this next chapter together.
Love,
Emmanuel Singh

We’re reaching out on behalf of Genser Marroquin, a hardworking and passionate young entrepreneur who poured his heart and soul into opening Maguilar Deli Café in early 2024. Located in our beloved neighborhood, this small deli quickly became a favorite spot for many — not just because of its delicious food, but because of Genser’s warm smile and unwavering dedication to his dream.
Unfortunately, tragedy struck on August 10th, when a devastating car crash severely damaged the deli. The impact caused significant structural damage, and the building was declared unsafe and unusable. In an instant, Genser lost his main source of income — his livelihood — and the dream he worked so hard to build is left hanging in uncertainty.
Genser didn’t come from much, but he’s always given his all. He spent years saving up to open Maguilar Deli Café, often working long hours and sacrificing personal comfort to create a better future for himself and serve his community. He created more than just a deli — he built a space where people felt at home
Every dollar counts, and any support — whether it’s a donation or simply sharing this page — will help Genser get back on his feet. Let’s come together and show him that the same community he served is here for him in his time of need.

Nos dirigimos a ustedes en nombre de Genser Marroquín, un joven emprendedor trabajador y apasionado que puso todo su corazón y alma en la apertura de Maguilar Deli Café a principios del 2024. Ubicado en nuestro querido vecindario, este pequeño deli se convirtió rápidamente en un lugar favorito para muchos — no solo por su deliciosa comida, sino también por la cálida sonrisa de Genser y su inquebrantable dedicación a su sueño.
Lamentablemente, la tragedia golpeó el 10 de agosto, cuando un devastador accidente automovilístico dañó gravemente el deli. El impacto causó  daños estructurales, y el edificio fue declarado inseguro e inutilizable. En un instante, Genser perdió su principal fuente de ingresos — su sustento — y el sueño por el que tanto luchó quedó en la incertidumbre.
Genser no viene de una vida fácil, pero siempre ha dado todo de sí. Pasó años ahorrando para poder abrir Maguilar Deli Café, trabajando largas jornadas y sacrificando su comodidad personal para construir un mejor futuro y servir a su comunidad. Él creó más que un simple deli — construyó un espacio donde las personas se sentían como en casa.
Cada dólar cuenta, y cualquier tipo de apoyo — ya sea una donación o simplemente compartir esta página — ayudará a que Genser pueda levantarse nuevamente. Unámonos y demostremos que esta comunidad a la que él ha servido está ahora para apoyarlo en su momento de necesidad.
1 Tesalonicenses 5:16-18
16 Alégrense siempre,
17 oren sin cesar,
18 den gracias a Dios en toda situación, porque esta es su voluntad para ustedes en Cristo Jesús.
Gracias por su bondad, generosidad y apoyo",4740,56.0,"High-visibility clothing, Workwear"

My name is Ben. I’m a sushi chef living in Los Angeles.
I’ve decided to start my own sushi catering company, specializing in omakase dinner parties.
I’ve been making sushi for 7 years now and have always wanted to start my own company. I recently started investing in the equipment I need to get started, but I still need some help.
I'm hoping this will take off and one day lead to owning my own sushi bar.
I’ve always worked for someone else, living paycheck to paycheck, wishing I could be self-employed to better support my daughter and fiancé. Today, I’m starting the journey of turning that dream into a reality.

I’ve been training athletes since 2018, and in 2023 I launched my own program to help players grow not only as athletes, but as people.
My mission is simple: use basketball to teach discipline, confidence, and resilience. I work with kids as young as 7 all the way to college and pro players.
The challenge? In New York City, gym rentals cost over $100/hour, and I don’t yet have consistent space. To fully serve my athletes, I’m raising $50,000 by January 2026.
This funding will:
•	Secure gym space for 6–9 months
•	Complete my I’m Possible Training certification
•	Cover a modest salary so I can focus on training full-time
•	Provide 3 months of free training to 5 students who can’t afford it
This is bigger than basketball—it’s about building character and changing lives.
To learn more about me or my training program, you can follow me on Instagram @enbballtraining.

Anything you can do will help us Keep Growing.
Victory Urban Gardens is dedicated to building local urban gardens where everything is free to pick—One for Me, One for the Neighbor, and One for Sale.
We start by selling organic, heritage, and heirloom veggie and herb starter plants by donation (you've probably seen my posts). This helps to pay the bills and finance the garden. All proceeds go to supporting our mission to fill local gardens and make nutritious food accessible to those who need it most while expanding the future abilities of the organization to continue growing to reach a national level. Currently we have funded a solar project and are in the process of installing a large enough system to maintain off grid capabilities. Next we will be developing a bio bag providing gas and fertilizer out of food scraps.
We’re also working to develop an online school and tutoring program to train more professional growers and encourage others to bring this vision to their neighborhoods. This will be geared towards helping keep generational homes in low income areas in the hands of the families that will be part in the tudoring program. The aim will be to keep large corporations from buying out family homes which is changing the landscape of American cities.
Very long term goal is a reverse mortgage program to help the elderly remain in their homes while pairing them up with family members that will grow and maintain a garden around them while they are still able to remain at home.
Keeping American families together.
If you believe in family, access to great food and building stronger communities, please consider supporting Victory Urban Gardens. Every donation helps us plant more gardens and move closer to making healthy food truly free and available for all.
Thank you for helping us Make America Farm Again! Front and Backyard gardens will Make America Strong Again.
In loving memory of Aunt Barb..

I am raising money for greatly needed equipment and supplies that will help me in reaching my career goals. I currently have several artist markets on the books (which I am extremely grateful for) and need additional items to display my work effectively. I am also in DESPERATE need of a new laptop - No offense to my current laptop that I am typing this on, but she's on her last leg.

Nikon Z50II + lens kit and camera bag
Flourish Mesh Panels for indoor and outdoor artwork display at pop-up markets
Adobe Subscription for photography and illustration/design
Microsoft Subscription
Studio Space (aka help with rent since my studio is in my apartment)

Hi, my name is Nemuel David Suárez Gierbolini. I'm a young college student from Puerto Rico looking to make a change in the world. I've started this fundraising process to start a small local business about recycled plastic materials. I have grown a passion for recycling plastic and giving them a new life, turning then into practical products. I've noticed the amount of plastic waste that's not being recycled in Puerto Rico and I feel the need to do something about it. I've made various things out of recycled plastic, all handmade, like rings, coasters, and some domino's. My mission is to raise funds to afford some machinery to Kickstart my small business and be able to maintain a more reliable working environment, eventually making more products to sell and lowering the amount of plastics that are ending up in the landfills and beaches. I have tons of ideas for practical products that can be made with recycled plastic but I need some help, if you're as passionate as me to make a small change in the world, it will mean everything to me if you'd help me fulfill this dream.Thank you for your time!",70,56.0,"Hand, Finger, Nail, Wrist, Thumb"

I am asking for help I desperately need to keep the brand running. I started this brand in 2015 and it’s been my heart & soul since. I work hard and there is no task I am above. While I love what I do, this year has been brutal. Savings are drained. I’m trying my best to push through but it’s getting near the end.
Yesterday, I cut part of my finger off while cropping a batch of tanks for open orders. A friend in the building rushed me to the ER but the remainder of my finger was unable to be reattached. I’m trying to give myself the time to heal while getting help with fulfillment.
This amount will cover me for the upcoming weeks with warehouse fees, so I can focus on my medical bills and keeping the brand going.
I truly appreciate you. If you don’t have anything to give, good energy helps too! Thank you.

The menu reflects two French backgrounds (Montreal & France) and is influenced by Nadia's travel abroad, having immersed herself in different communities' cultures and their love for food.
Our much beloved cafe is having to move down the street from their present location. The landlords decided to not renew Nadia's lease so she is renovating the former Jackman's Fuels location on Main Street in Vergennes.
I have created this fundraiser to help with the cost of renovation and moving.
This move to a new location is bitter sweet for Nadia but also an opportunity to make the new space all their own.
As Nadia said on her Instagram feed:
""Turning heartache into celebration. Today I have fired the Woodfire oven for the last time. Although not our last weekend ( August 17th is our last day in this location) it will be the last time we bake bread allowing for the Woodfire oven to cool down before we removed it. I wish I could say we are moving it to install it in the new shop but an oven like this does not work that way and can only be used for parts that remain. I want to tell you the last few months there has been so many tears, fears , body aches, lawyers and doubt of my ability to make it through it. I don’t know why people do what they do. Someone told me I don’t understand it because I would I never do it to another and somehow it calmed me.
But today, is an end of an era for this beautiful woodstove that I bought with all my savings and a loan from the previous owner. Today this beautiful woodfire will make our bread, I remember how long it took me to understand her, I called her my master, she made me cry she ate all my butter and chocolate and burnt my bread but slowly I learned her, slowly she became a friend who took what I offered and gave beautiful loaves and pastries in return .
Today I want to turn this sadness into celebration! I want to honor her by doing what we have done all along make good food for good people. As I fed her with wood all night, I slowly thanked her, I am sad but I want this sadness to rise to something more a celebration of her, of what we have done here together. To Ryan who learned the oven in the early days with me, Jesse who baked anything she can think up out of there and my dear husband Kevin, that somehow agreed to help out one day and ended up mastering it- thank you for putting up with heat and making magic.
I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE INCREDIBLE LOVE AND KINDNESS. THE COMMENTS, EMAILS, DM AND NOTES HAVE TOUCHED MY HEART, MY STAFF AND FAMILY - SO GRATEFUL.""

From veteran appreciation nights and open mics to national headliners and local showcases, this stage has been a place where laughter brings people together.
Recently, we announced that we would be closing our doors. But the overwhelming support from the community reminded us how much this club means to San Antonio — and that we have to fight to keep it alive.
Right now, we need your help to cover urgent costs and keep the doors open:
$4,000 – IRS payment to settle immediate obligations
$4,000 – Rent payment to keep our space secure
Total Goal: $6,000
Every dollar will go directly toward these critical expenses. Once these are covered, we’ll be able to stabilize operations and continue bringing shows, festivals, and opportunities to the community.
How you can help:
Donate – Every contribution, no matter the size, brings us closer to saving the club.
Share – Spread the word on Facebook, Instagram, and with friends.
Support – Come out to shows, tag us, and keep Upstage Comedy Lounge part of the San Antonio story.
We believe laughter heals, unites, and empowers. With your help, the show will go on.
Thank you for standing with us.

From the very beginning, coffee has been at the heart of our friendship. It’s where we’ve connected, dreamed, and talked about “someday” owning a cozy coffee shop of our own.
That “someday” starts here — with Lone Cow Coffee, our first step toward turning this passion into our life’s work.
We’ve poured evenings, weekends, and every bit of free time into building this little cart while balancing full-time jobs. Every board, every detail has been a labor of love to bring this dream to life.
See the dream come to life — watch us build our cart! [

For us, this isn’t just about serving lattes and cappuccinos. Lone Cow Coffee is about creating a space for connection — whether that’s at a wedding, a farmer’s market, or a local gathering. And one day, we hope to grow this cart into a full-time brick-and-mortar shop where everyone feels welcome.
Starting a business is exciting, but it also comes with a lot of costs — from equipment to permits to supplies that will help us craft the perfect cup. With your support, you’re not just helping us build a cart; you’re helping us bring a dream to life. Every donation, big or small, brings us closer to sharing our love of coffee and community with more people.

My Story & My New Mission
My name is Mike Compton, and I'm a Marine Corps veteran. In the Marines, I learned about discipline, commitment, and the importance of a mission. After serving, I knew I wanted my next mission to be one that served my local community here in Central Illinois. That's why I'm launching Vet Grown Greens.
Our mission is simple:
to provide local chefs and restaurants with the freshest, highest-quality herbs and greens possible, grown right here in our community. The national food supply chain is fragile, and by the time produce gets to our local restaurants, it's often days old and has lost much of its flavor and nutritional value. Vet Grown Greens will solve that problem by delivering produce that is harvested less than 24 hours before it reaches the chef's kitchen.
The Plan:
A Lean, Bootstrapped Launch
I've spent hundreds of hours developing a lean, efficient, and financially sound business plan. Instead of taking on massive loans, I'm starting this farm by bootstrapping it from the ground up, right in my own garage. The plan is to convert my garage into a productive, controlled environment aquaponics farm, built with a
DIY
approach to be as efficient and resourceful as possible.
Aquaponics is a sustainable system where fish provide natural, organic fertilizer for the plants. It's a closed-loop system that uses 90% less water than traditional agriculture and allows us to grow year-round, regardless of the Illinois weather.
The Ask:
Help Us Build the Farm
I'm putting my own savings into this launch, but to get across the finish line, I need your help. We need to raise funds for both the core farm equipment and the essential professional services to get the garage ready for a safe and successful launch.
Our goal is to raise $2,900 to fund all the essential startup costs. Every dollar gets us closer to our first harvest.
Join the Mission & Become a Founder

​(Reward available for local pickup or delivery within a 30-mile radius of Paxton, IL only. We will contact you via email after the campaign to arrange fulfillment)
Tier 4:

​(Reward available for local pickup or delivery within a 30-mile radius of Paxton, IL only. We will contact you via email after the campaign to arrange fulfillment)
Here's Exactly Where Your Contribution Goes:
1.
Grow Beds ($253)
Justification: These two large trays are the foundation of the farm, providing a food-safe, reliable, and flood-proof surface for our crops to grow on.
2.
Plumbing System ($525)
Justification: These raw materials are the circulatory system of the farm. They will be hand-fabricated into eight vertical aeroponic towers and the gravity-fed drain lines, creating a sustainable, closed-loop system.
3.
Life Support System (Aquaponics Core)
Barracuda RO/DI Water Filter ($200):
Our local water is too harsh for delicate fish and plants. This filter purifies it completely, creating the perfect, clean water foundation for our ecosystem.
150-Gallon Stock Tank ($90):
This tank is the heart of the farm. It will be the home for our fish, whose natural waste becomes the organic fertilizer that feeds all of our plants.
Submersible Pump ($90):
The ""engine"" of the farm. This reliable pump circulates the nutrient-rich water from the fish to the plants, 24/7.
In-Line & Bio-Filters ($90):
These filters keep the water clean and provide a home for beneficial bacteria, which are the microscopic engines that convert fish waste into plant food.
4.
Grow Environment & Lighting
T5 Style LED Grow Lights ($172):
This high-efficiency LED fixture provides the full-spectrum light our plants need for healthy, rapid growth, ensuring a consistent, year-round harvest.
Dehumidifier ($125):
An aquaponics farm creates a very humid environment. This dehumidifier is essential for preventing mold and protecting the health of our crops.
5.
Processing & Food Safety
Stainless Steel Prep Table ($100):
A professional, food-safe surface is non-negotiable for harvesting and packaging our greens for restaurants.
5-Gallon Salad Spinner ($150):
This commercial-grade spinner is critical for drying our herbs after washing, dramatically extending their shelf life.
Utility Sink ($60):
A dedicated sink is required for all washing and sanitation, forming the cornerstone of our food safety protocols.
Miter Saw ($100):
This essential tool will be used to make the precise cuts on the PVC pipes needed to build our vertical aeroponic towers.
6.
Professional Services
Electrician ($800):
Safety is paramount. A licensed electrician is needed to install new, dedicated GFCI outlets and ensure our breaker panel can safely handle the load of the lights, pumps, and other equipment.
Every contribution, no matter the size, brings us one step closer to launching and anything extra goes into building the business and increasing our reach to the community.

We need your support.
Cakechella was created to celebrate what makes our community so special—local bakers, small businesses, and neighbors who come together over a shared love of sweets. What began as a joyful idea to connect people through cake and creativity is now under attack.
Coachella, the massive California music festival, is trying to shut us down with claims of cybersquatting. Their accusations have no merit. Cakechella isn’t their brand—it’s ours. It belongs to our community, built with heart, hard work, and the support of people right here in the DMV.
The reality is simple: they think a billion-dollar corporation can bully a grassroots event into backing down. They expect us to stay quiet, to fold under pressure. But we refuse. Cakechella will happen. And we won’t let them erase the voices, dreams, and businesses that this festival uplifts.
But here’s the truth—fighting back is costly. That’s where you come in.
For just $5, you can help protect a festival that supports YOUR neighbors—local bakers, treat makers, and small businesses who pour their hearts into what they do. Your $5 sends a message louder than any lawsuit: community creativity matters, and we won’t be silenced.
Every dollar counts. Every share spreads the word. Every contribution—no matter how small—helps defend Cakechella and the people behind it.
Thank you for standing with us, believing in Cakechella, and helping us prove that when a community comes together, even the biggest corporations can’t take away what we’ve built.",1825,26.0,"Logo, Night"

Lollipop Shoppe needs yr support + it's urgent. Lollipop Shoppe opened in 2022 + is a live music venue + dance club + community space in SE Portland, Oregon. We've hosted thousands of artists, DJs + music lovers over these past three years, all while navigating the increased costs of small business ownership, a post-pandemic music industry + some big learning curves that come along with new business ownership.
The roots of Lollipop Shoppe began nearly 10 years ago as a series of house shows. As those grew more popular, we began renting warehouses + started an annual music festival / promotions company called Lose Yr Mind. We bootstrapped our way here using our food service tips + community support. In 2021 we reached the point of being able to purchase our own venue space (previously called Dig A Pony). After a decade of hard work, our dream came true.
We've hosted a wide away of artists over the years + frequently lend our space to causes + communities that aren't always offered the stage. We pay artists well, have a devoted team + love being part of our neighborhood. We're 100% woman owned, which is something that is rare in this industry + something we're super proud of. It wasn't easy getting to this point. Lollipop has hosted some of the best shows we've ever seen, raised funds for those in need + looks out for the Portland music community / our neighbors in general. Bands from rural Thailand to West Africa have graced our stage
Thailand to West Africa have graced our stage.
On the weekends you can dance to a range of DJs spinning Cumbia, House, Amapiano, Hip Hop, Disco + more. One of the best things about Lollipop Shoppe is the diversity of our programming. There's something for everyone + it's a place for everyone.
We've hosted nights that feature trans femme artists, are the home of the monthly hip hop showcase The Thesis + produce an array of special events on the weekend from kids music recitals to drag brunches. One of our roles in the community is to help artists grow + give them a place to cut their teeth. We are and incubator room that offers excellent sound, a beautiful space + good pay. Artists that have an audience much larger than our capacity have opted to play here for multiple nights because of the magic of this space. IYKYK.
It's been a marathon keeping our doors open these past three years. Last year our insurance increased to over $5k a month without incident or claims. We've been broken into several times + have debt that's incurred to keep going. We need relief. Being financially creative is draining + detracts from us being able to work on business development + grow. Summer is the slowest time for an indoor venue + we're at the end of a tough one. A number of larger, unexpected expenses (equipment repairs, a flood, some ownership changeover etc) have incurred + it's been tough. Lollipop Shoppe needs support to remain open.
Funds raised from this campaign will be used to pay bills, staff, artists + grow our programming. In order to increase revenue we're adding more events during the day on the weekends + adding more shows Mondays + Tuesdays. This stabilize us + allow us to succeed. We've already seen the results of some of that. But we need a stop gap. Event growth doesn't happen over night. We also need funds to increase marketing so event are better attended. We are often busy, but being a little busier is what is needed.
So here we are, asking y'all for help. We've put everything + then some into this. It's our life + it's been difficult, but we're here for the long haul. The Portland venue music community wouldn't be the same without a space like Lollipop + we're constantly hearing from artists + guests that this place is special + meaningful.
If you can, please contribute to us succeeding. To us being less hand to mouth + being less being less stressed. To finally having a buffer so we can absorb life's curveballs. We don't have any more funds to contribute, so we need you. This is not a drill. We will not be able to continue without folks showing up. It's hard to be this vulnerable + ask for this type of help, but we believe everyone benefits from us being funded + continuing. We promise the returns will be there.

After eight years of working in professional kitchens, starting as a donut finisher and steadily progressing to pastry chef, I’m taking the leap to starting my own endeavor. I’m raising to cover the essential startup costs that will allow me to begin production, rent kitchen space, and start selling at local markets and events. This project really blends my background in fine art and chemistry with my deep love for sweet treats, providing a whole new avenue for my culinary creativity.
My ice cream isn't just dessert—it's a canvas for playful, unexpected, and comforting flavors. I’ve spent years recipe testing, developing unique spins on classics, and dreaming of ways to make people smile through small, sweet moments. With your support, I’ll be able to purchase a larger-scale ice cream maker, secure a commissary kitchen, and stock the ingredients, packaging, and supplies I need to get started. I’ve created a detailed cost breakdown to keep everything transparent, from business licensing to custom stamps and kitchen equipment.
Those of you who know me will know that, over the course of working in bakeries for my entire career, I have developed a skin allergy to wheat products. I am constantly in a cycle of using steroid creams on my hands and arms to reduce the symptoms of redness, rash, and skin that cracks until bleeding. I use gloves religiously in the pastry kitchen, but my body is in desperate need of a step back from working with my allergens. So, the move to ice cream is also a balm for my suffering immune response.
Your contribution will directly help cover:
– $2,100 for kitchen space rental (first, last, and deposit)
– $825 for an ice cream machine
– ~$1,000 for supplies like pots, pans, packaging, and ingredients
– Licenses, insurance, and LLC fees totaling around $1,000
– Monthly costs like storage, car rentals for supply runs, and insurance
Any extra funds raised will go towards a soft serve machine and other maintaining costs.
Every dollar truly helps, and even a share or kind word means the world.
As a trans woman working to build something of my own, this business isn’t just about ice cream—it’s about self-sufficiency, visibility, and the power of creating and sharing moments of joy in a world that isn’t always built to support people like me. Your support goes beyond helping launch a dream—it helps me carve out a future where I can sustain myself doing what I love, in my own way. If you believe in me, queer-owned small businesses, in the magic of dessert, or in the importance of giving someone a real shot—this could be your chance to be part of something beautiful.",5124,86.0,"Eyewear, Smile, Chin, Glasses, Vision Care"

It started with a personal injury trial lawyer who had children and decided that creating a space for people to have fun was more important than making a lot of money, being someone who wasn't really him (me). Our customers have become very special to us. Mr. Marc is watching a fourth generation grow up since the store opened. I don't know when the store became more than a business, but it has. I say this because so many people have expressed this to me. The problem has always been that I don't like to think of The Glazery as a business, and I've done a terrible job as a business owner. The Glazery has come to a crossroads. I have two choices: try and sell as much as I can between now and the end of the year, hoping I can pay off all the debt I've accumulated, and then close the store. The other is to swallow my pride and admit that I need help and try to keep The Glazery going. As I've mentioned to many of you, I'm aware of things I could do to increase revenue, but implementing those changes would alter The Glazery. As I've always said, The Glazery will remain as The Glazery, or I will close it.
So, I am taking the second choice. I am asking for your support in coming to the store to paint and possibly contributing to this GoFundMe so I can pay off my debts before they force the store to close. I understand that some people will lose respect for me and the store for going this route. I am not entirely comfortable doing it, but it seems like my only option at this point.
Regardless of whether this works or not, it has truly been an honor to meet and watch so many of you grow up. I don't have the words to express how much you have all meant to me, Mickayla, and Daynah, though she is no longer with us. Saying thank you hardly seems enough, but thank you.

We’re the family behind Dodo Bakery, a small Hong Kong-style bakery that’s been serving up fresh, nostalgic pastries and breads for the past three years. Our original 800 sq. ft. shop has been loved by the community since day one—and don’t worry, we’re not closing it! We’re just growing.
Thanks to all of your support, we’ve outgrown our space and are ready to open a second location in the heart of Philadelphia, at 510 Walnut Street. It’s a busy area full of tourists, locals, and history, and we can’t wait to bring our Hong Kong flavors to an even bigger crowd.
We’ve already signed the lease and were ready to start renovations—until we were hit with an unexpected requirement. After everything was finalized, we were told we have to use a union contractor for all the build-out work. This was never mentioned during the year-long negotiations, and the cost is way beyond what we had planned for.
As a small, family-run bakery, this sudden increase has put us in a tough spot. That’s why we’re reaching out to you—our community—for help.
Any support you can give will help us move forward and bring our second location to life. We’re so excited about this next chapter, and with your help, we can make it happen.
Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We promise to keep baking with love and sharing the best of Hong Kong-style treats with all of you—both in our current shop and soon, in our brand new space.",2205,88.0,Label

Dear Friends, Family, and Community Supporters,
I’m reaching out with a heavy heart to share some unfortunate news. On August 23, 2025, at 1:20 am, a catastrophic fire completely ravaged my father’s self-made mechanic shop, Angel’s Trucks Repair Inc., located in Long Beach Wilmington. What started as a small fire quickly escalated into an inferno that left nothing but complete destruction. The entire building, inventory, equipment, customer trucks, and years of hard work were completely lost overnight.
Angel’s Trucks Repair Inc. was founded 10 years ago, and through those years, we have given service to semi-trucks either through general mechanic work, AC, overhauls, tune-ups, etc. For my father, Angel, this was a dream built from scratch, fueled by passion, perseverance, and lots of sacrifice. Now, unfortunately, it’s all gone, and we’re left picking up the pieces.
The fire not only destroyed our physical space but also our livelihoods. Ten employees are left without work, facing uncertainty. Eight customers are left without their semi-trucks. We’ve lost original truck parts (radiators, oil pumps, starters, batteries, oil/fuel filters, O-rings, etc.), our forklift, and two company trucks. Unfortunately, insurance may not cover everything that was lost.
We want to rise back up and rebuild, which is why we’re launching this GoFundMe to raise money to:
• Cover immediate needs like temporary relocation and support for our employees.
• Purchase essential equipment and inventory to get back on our feet.
• Pay customers for their total loss trucks.
• Handle any uncovered costs from cleanup and legal fees.
Every donation, no matter how small, will make a real difference in helping us rebuild. If you can’t donate, please share this campaign with your network—your support in spreading the word is just as valuable.
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for standing with us during this incredibly difficult time. Your generosity gives us hope and reminds us that we’re not alone.
With deepest gratitude,
Angel G Perez(jr) and Angel Perez, owner of Angel’s Trucks Repair Inc.

Studio West is moving to a new location this summer and while you might think this is a huge undertaking while I’m going through treatment for triple negative breast cancer, I know this is the right time.
My incredible medical team (oncologist, surgeon, nurses and others) are encouraging me to plan for a future beyond cancer. So, that’s exactly what I’m doing.
This move is not just about a new location; it’s about reclaiming our space and forging a brighter future for our current and future students.
The new studio will offer easy walking access to Black Sheep and other food and activities in the Short North, making it a perfect spot for families. Our new spot will also allow us to expand our programming to include guest instructors along with specialty programming like art and music therapy.
And I could use a little help. I have been very fortunate to have health insurance and the support from my parents and Misty Linn - so I don't have the same financial hardships as others battling this same disease. I am very grateful and don’t take it for granted.
But my life has still been deeply impacted because I haven’t been able to perform as often which has impacted my income - these are funds that I always channel directly into Studio West.
That’s why we’re reaching out to you. We could use some help to cover the costs of our move and to make necessary improvements to our new space.
We don’t yet have our non-profit designation so your donations will not be tax deductible, but please know that every dollar will go directly to our Studio West program, helping children and their families navigate life’s challenges through performing arts.
Thank you for your consideration. At Studio West, you never have to hide. You were born to shine just exactly as you are, and we are committed to celebrating and supporting you every step of the way.

On August 18th, 2025, something heartbreaking happened at our shop. After returning from a pop-up, I walked in to find that two of our shelving units had collapsed. All of our body oils spilled onto the floor, our glass measuring cups shattered, and nearly every container was broken. We had just invested $1,500 into supplies to fulfill wholesale orders, and everything was already mixed and ready to be bottled. In an instant, it was all gone.
This loss has put us in a very vulnerable position as a small business. Not only did we lose product and supplies, but we also lost the income that those wholesale orders would have brought in. As a small, community-rooted business, every dollar counts, and this setback is one that we cannot recover from alone.

Deena Marie
—a singer-songwriter, independent artist, and storyteller who believes that music isn’t just entertainment. It’s a lifeline, a mirror, and sometimes even a call to action.
I write folk for the soul—songs that carry truth, courage, and connection. Some of my music is deeply personal, rooted in love, healing, and sobriety. Other songs carry a political charge, echoing the timeless tradition of protest folk. What ties it all together is one core belief: music with meaning matters.
I’ve already released a handful of songs into the world—including “Karoline,” “Relax Take It Easy,”  ""West Coast (California Dreaming),"" “Tear the Fascists Down (Again)”—and the response has shown me how hungry people are for real, authentic songs that speak to both the heart and the times we’re living in.
Now, I’m ready to take the next step: recording a full album that captures the spectrum of what I stand for—politics, love, courage, and transformation.
Why I’m Asking for Your Help
Making an album independently is beautiful but expensive. Studio time, mixing, mastering, musicians, production, and distribution all add up quickly. As an artist without a label behind me, every note I record and every lyric I release depends on community support.
Your contribution will go directly toward:
Studio sessions to capture the songs with the highest quality.
Collaborating with musicians and producers who bring the music to life.
Mixing & mastering so the songs sound just as powerful in your headphones as they do live.
Distribution & promotion, so these songs can reach the ears—and hearts—of people around the world.
Why It Matters
We live in a world where so much music feels disposable. But I believe folk music—the kind that speaks to the soul, confronts injustice, and reminds us of our humanity—still has a vital place. This album isn’t just songs; it’s a message, a movement, and a way to keep truth-telling alive in melody.
Every dollar raised is fuel for that mission. And every supporter is part of this album’s story.
How You Can Help
Donate whatever you can—big or small, it all makes a real difference.
Share this fundraiser with your friends, family, and networks.
Follow along on Spotify, AppleMusic,  Instagram, and TikTok to be part of my journey as an artist.
A Note From Me
Thank you for helping me bring this album into the world. Together, we can keep folk alive—for the heart, for the soul, and for the times.

Every day, we see firsthand how much value and life remains in furniture, art, clothing, and household goods. Our goal is to honor these items, divert waste, and find them new homes where they can continue to be loved and used.
To take this work to the next level, we are launching a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for a work van—specifically a used Ford Transit.
Having a dedicated vehicle would be transformational for our business.
Right now, transportation is one of our biggest barriers. With a van, we could pick up and deliver larger items, assist more clients in need, and increase the volume of goods we can save from landfills. It’s a practical, powerful step forward that will make our operations smoother, faster, and more impactful.
Our fundraising goal is to cover the cost of the van, but if we are fortunate enough to raise beyond that, the additional funds will go toward leasing a larger warehouse space to store, organize, and showcase items before they find their next home. Extra support will also help us launch Berryfine Goods Gives (BGG), our future nonprofit branch. Through BGG, we aim to extend our reach into the community by redistributing essentials—such as furniture, clothing, and household goods—directly to individuals and families who need them most.
By supporting this campaign,
you are not just funding a van—you are fueling a vision of sustainability, compassion, and circular reuse.
Every contribution, large or small, helps us grow our capacity to serve clients, reduce waste, and give back to our community. Together, we can make a meaningful impact and create a system where nothing of value goes to waste.",628,11.0,

My name is Kyle Bender with Skeemn Entertainment
Over the last year, we’ve had the honor of transforming space in the historic Luminaria Building in downtown Spokane into something truly special for the local arts and music scene. From First Friday art galleries to multiple recording studios, community events, and creative collaborations, this space has quickly grown into a cultural hub and a home for artists of all kinds.
Unfortunately, due to a series of abrupt circumstances, we’ve hit a financial corner that puts our progress at risk. While our long-term plans and 3-year lease position us for a sustainable future, we need help bridging this immediate moment.
We’re seeking to raise $3,000–$5,000 to cover the next month’s rent and high power bills—giving us the time we need to stabilize, bring in more rentals, and build on what we’ve started.
Every dollar donated directly supports keeping this creative hub alive for Spokane’s community of musicians, artists, and dreamers. Together, we can make sure this space continues to inspire, create, and grow for years to come.
If you believe in Spokane’s music and arts culture, please consider donating or sharing this campaign. Your support makes all the difference.",600,13.0,"T-shirt, Hat, Shirt, Fashion, Event"

For four years, I operated out of a building, serving up barbecue to loyal customers and building a reputation for quality and community. When rising costs made it impossible to keep the doors open, I decided to take Got Smoked BBQ on the road with a food trailer, determined to keep the tradition alive and continue serving the people who love our food.
The trailer needs essential upgrades to get back in business—fire suppression system, electrical work, plumbing for sinks, propane setup, and a generator cage. These improvements are required not only for safety and compliance, but also to meet Health Department standards and secure the permits needed to operate. With these repairs, I’ll be able to park in the spot customers expect, serve daily meals, and bring Got Smoked BBQ to local events, weddings, and gatherings. The demand is already there, with invitations to fall events and weddings in the coming months, and a steady stream of travelers visiting our lake community.
Refurbishing the trailer means more than just reopening—it’s about continuing to share great barbecue, supporting our local community, and being present for the celebrations and everyday moments that bring people together. Every contribution helps bring Got Smoked BBQ back to life, so I can keep serving the food and experiences that matter most to our friends, neighbors, and visitors.",440,13.0,

It seems like a specter stalking us all. Everyone I know has their own unique, scary relationship with cancer. Personally, cancer took my grandmother before I was able to know her. And it threatened to take my mom as well, when she was diagnosed with single cell myeloma some years ago. I was blessed to watch my mom go through the amazing care system provided by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, and make a full recovery through the embrace of cutting-edge medical science. I only wish this kind of care was available to everyone that needs it.
I too worry more and more about getting cancer as the years go by, trying to govern my behaviors to minimize the chances of getting it, but also feeling helpless to control the inevitability of colliding with cancer in some shape or form.
This is why I want to raise money for the American Cancer Society by running 100 miles in the month of October. It is empowering to use my love of running to make even a small difference in funding cancer research.
So donate some money, or share this fundraiser with someone who has money to donate, and I will forever be grateful that you imbued something I love with so much extra purpose.

Think of recess—musical chairs, hopscotch, Connect 4, hula hoop contests—but designed to help grown-ups laugh, connect, and build community again.
For the past two years, I have faced unemployment and countless “no’s” in my job search. Instead of giving up, I decided to create my own opportunity. That’s how Pres Play was born—a vision to provide fun, safe, and affordable game nights that bring people together in a unique way.
But as any start-up founder knows, getting a dream off the ground takes resources. I am asking for your support to help cover the costs of:
Securing venues for the first game nights
Purchasing equipment and supplies for the games
Marketing and promotion to spread the word
Building the foundation for a sustainable community-based business
Your contribution—no matter how big or small—will directly help me turn this dream into reality. If you’re not able to donate, you can still support by sharing this campaign with your friends and networks.
After two years of doors being closed, I am determined to open my own. With your help, Pres Play can launch and become a space where laughter, fun, and human connection come alive again.
Thank you so much for believing in me and this vision.

That truck was my lifeline—I use it to get to jobs, haul tools and materials, and run my handyman and renovation business. Without it, I can’t work. I’ve launched this GoFundMe to help get a reliable replacement and get back to doing what I do best: building, fixing, and earning an honest living.
My name is Patrick. I’m a queer tradesman and home renovation specialist with 20+ years of experience. I take pride in working with my hands, solving problems, and making spaces better for the people who live in them.
The truck that was destroyed was a 2006 Dodge Dakota. It wasn’t fancy, but it got the job done—and I relied on it every single day. It hauled lumber, tools, tile, paint, equipment, and most importantly—it hauled me to work.
Now that it’s gone, I’m stuck. Without a vehicle, I can’t take on jobs. I can’t earn. I can’t stay afloat.
I’m not asking for a brand-new truck—just enough help to get a used, reliable work vehicle and cover registration, insurance, and the basic costs that come with starting over after a total loss.
The goal is $16,000, which will go toward:
•	Purchasing a used truck that can haul materials
•	Insurance and registration fees
•	Any emergency repairs, taxes, or setup costs
•	Replace some tools/equipment, etc that were also damaged
I know times are hard for a lot of people. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t urgent. Even $10 makes a difference. And a share helps more than you know.

I am the inventor of
Retract-a-Band
; a one-of-a-kind exercise resistance band device with comfortable grips for both hands!
Each handle can automatically retract the band to make it shorter or extend the band to make it longer. This means,
YOU CAN CHANGE THE LENGTH OF THE EXERCISE BAND AND ALWAYS HAVE THE COMFY GRIPS TO HOLD ONTO WITH BOTH HANDS!
There isn't any other device in the world like Retract-a-Band;
a PATENT PENDING
device that is an exercise workout all in the palm of your hands, literally!
No more letting go of the handle of your exercise band to have to grab it directly (which always slips out of your hand).
No need to buy multiple bands for different resistances or strengths.
Just adjust Retract-a-Band to the length or strength that you need and exercise always with a comfortable grip for your hands.
At the end of your resistive exercise band workout, just flip open both locking mechanisms, line the band up with the openings,
allow the Retract-a-Band to wrap itself inside each handle
, and snap shut the locking mechanisms.
It even has connector magnets
on the back of each handle that clicks them together for easy storage until your next Retract-a-Band exercise session.
Retract-a-Band is a ""Game Changer"" and a NEW WAVE in resistance band exercise workouts! AND . . .
It costs money to get it started!!!
So . . . . . . . . . . . . . We Need to Raise Some Funds!
In December of 2025, the actual price will be $44.72 plus tax, S&H and just crazy other fees making
your donation of $50.00 a perfect amount!
Thank you for reading all the way through and considering a donation to Retract-a-Band. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you if you go to our website at Retract-a-Band .com. Finally, Thank you a Thousand Times if you donate more.
You are going to make Retract-a-Band famous!
Sincerely,
John
